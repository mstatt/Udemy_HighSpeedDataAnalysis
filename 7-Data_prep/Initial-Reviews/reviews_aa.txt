Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.	2005-10-14

This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.	2005-10-14

The book covers facts regarding the history of the organization Habitat for Humanity and the author's experiences volunteering. Goodrich writes about the places, the people, and the volunteers he has encountered during his five-year experience with Habitat for Humanity. The author speaks straight from the heart, some of which brought tears to my eyes, some of sadness, some of laughter. Even through all the heart-wrenching sights, Goodrich and his crew persevere, regardless of the obstacles they face. Goodrich's experiences include traveling around the world, from America to London from London to Paraguay even getting lost in the Sierra, Faith is a Verb, is a fantastic read. In addition, the book opens a person's eyes and heart to the devastation and suffering that many see everyday of their lives. The book puts into perspective just how lucky we are even though we may not think so; it made me not only look at my ethics and values but also encouraged me to pick up that hammer.	2005-10-14

But if you have read and enjoyed works such as the first two volumes of \\"Roots of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble following this book.    The author successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war.  Although he addresses behavior in the midst of battle, the author seems more interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were looking backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated or how they adjusted their feelings afterwards.  I think this \\"flavor\\" derives from his personal-interview-and-historical-research approach.  I do not see this as a negative but rather staying within his scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titled \\"Flawed work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\" seems too harshly critical.  Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stating that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\"  True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the author never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feeling that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without thinking into what was being presented.      Although now much more interested in peace studies, I enjoyed reading this book.  I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so.  I characterize it as an honest endeavor to address and understand some of the difficult questions that most of us have concerning death and killing in war-time.	2005-10-14

At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.	2005-10-14

It adds some great insight by several of the world's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional information from John Shaw, Arthur Morris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well worth the investment. <br /> <br />One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop for me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read. <br /> <br />The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as workflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a great workflow while introducing their own artistic approach. <br /> <br />No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" does a great job of specilizing for nature photographers.  As with any workshop, it does require the student to do some work to get the most out of the class. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. <br />	2005-10-14

Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here.	2005-10-14

Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something?	2005-10-14

However, Elizabeth Brownstein does. Through careful and thorough research, Ms. Brownstein addresses issues hitherto unexplored. Lincoln's summer home...provides a suitable setting to describe Lincoln's activities outside the White House.  One learns, for instance, that the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was completed here. One also learns that, far from being a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Pennsylvania Avenue, the home facilitated Lincoln's open-mindedness about receiving virtual strangers at virtually any hour of the day or night and resulted in serious sleep deprivation.  <br /> <br />However, it was in the other topics addressed in the book that Lincoln's character is at its most illuminating. His fascination with weaponry, his patience in his dealings with his wife, and his ability to establish collegial relationship with people of vastly differing temperaments are all thoughtfully explored...The characters highlighted are dispassionately analyzed in such a way as to enable the reader to be part of the scene at all times.  For instance, Lincoln's wife, so often pilloried...is given a fair hearing and is properly depicted as a courageous soul confronted by agonizing choices and exaggerated expectations of the First Lady's performance as a suitable consort of the most admired President in American History...Mrs. Brownstein provides a valuable service for readers interested in the less dramatic, but no less insightful, clues about Lincoln the President, confronted, as he was, by the unprecedented challenges associated with his era. <br />	2005-10-14

As a student at a university driven by both scholarly research and the party scene, I can picture many of the novel's more dramatic scenes.  Some, like the Saint Ray party toward the beginning or the intimidating neuroscience lecture hall, I felt as if i were remembering rather than reading.   <br /> <br />No, there is no university quite like Dupont, succeeding in academics and sports at the highest levels.  If he had not given the school these characteristics, however, Wolfe might have put himself at a disadvantage:  There would be less of a chance for a reader to identify with the university, the characters, the scenes, and his commentary would have been limited to fewer aspects of today's campuses.  A novel about an UNDERachieving university might be interesting as well, but I think the scope of I Am Charlotte Simmons, and Dupont in particular, was well suited to Wolfe's acute powers of observation.	2005-10-14

The reasons are manifest.  Villainous Lens Larque provides some of the best challenges and intimidation for our hero, Kirth Gersen.  There's the usual helping of exquisite writing and fine descriptions; the menu items during Gersen's restraunt visits are particularly noteworthy.  Most importantly, \\"The Face\\" is the most morally challenging novel in the series.  It presents, to some extent, the best argument for Gersen abandoning his single-minded hunt for revenge in his abortive attempts at romance with two characters.  Lastly, \\"The Face\\" has a killer ending, laugh-out-loud serious if there ever was such a thing. <br /> <br />Another notable element is the planet Dar Sai and its inhabitants, the Darsh.  Dar Sai is odd even by Vance standards.  Giant umbrellas of water protect folks from searing daytime heat, the women grow mustaches, food is prized for its repulsiveness and gender wars are taken to a whole new level.  Vance scores particular points by showing us the spoiled tourists who visit solely to mock the backwards Darsh.  An just dessert is served for them at the end, of course. <br /> <br />The last novel in the series, \\"The Book of Dreams\\", is competent but less biting than \\"The Face\\".  The new villain, Howard Alan Treesong, is less impressively hateable than Lens Larque or Viole Falshune from \\"The Palace of Love\\".  \\"The Book of Dreams\\" contains vignettes set on numerous planets, none of them particuarly brilliant.  The best parts of this novel are the introductory segments to each chapter.  Short paragraphs cover a wide range of ground, from the hilarious philosophical basis of the Institute to the stunning character introductions for Treesong's various Paladins.	2005-10-14

As someone who enjoys mysteries, as well as historical fiction and gothic novels of suspense, I was quite taken with this book. Intricately plotted, the book is clever in its premise. Two disparate human beings, a highly independent, red-headed slip of a woman, Samantha Flood, Australian by birth, and a serious, fervently religious Spaniard, Miguel Madero, who is half-English, find themselves thrust together, as each explores the tiny, remote Cumbrian village of Illthwaite in England, looking for answers to their individual quests.  Both are in Illthwaite to get information relative to that which each is seeking. Both are staying in the local inn, called The Stranger House.<br /><br />Samantha is a brilliant but brash mathematician in her early twenties. Fondly known as Sam to her friends, she is interested in tracing her familial roots. She has recently discovered that her paternal grandmother was from this part of the world,  having been a part of a huge number of children migrants that had been unceremoniously shipped from England to other parts of its Empire, including Australia. Samantha is interested in finding out more about her paternal grandmother and the mystery surrounding her.<br /><br />Miguel, or Mig, as he is known to his family and friends, is the scion of a well-known house of vintners in Spain and is in his late twenties. He is a former seminarian who has suffered from manifestations of what he believes to be stigmata. He also, on occasion, sees ghostly manifestations or visions. Recovering from a serious alpine accident that nearly killed him, he is now in Illthwaite ostensibly to do research  for his thesis on the experience of English Catholics during the Reformation. He is, however, actually in Illthwaite to find out more about an ancestor of his who mysteriously disappeared there centuries ago during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />In Illthwaite, Both Sam and Mig find themselves up against obstacles placed in their way. It seems that its residents are not totally forthcoming or are reluctant to part with information relative to their respective quests. What they each individually discover is that things are not always as they seem in Illthwaite.  Moreover, their divergent interests are more intertwined than they could ever have imagined. They will discover that they have more in common than they realized, having come full circle in a cosmic design not of their making.<br /><br />This book has well-drawn characters that come alive under the author's expert hand. The plot is unusual, as well as complex, containing many layers that the discerning reader will enjoy exploring. Well-written, as well as intricately plotted, this book crosses a number of genres. With its supernatural portents, historical underpinnings, underlying mystery, as well as its gothic type  suspense and sensibilities, infused with just a dollop of  romance, this book will appeal to those readers who favor these genres. In particular, I found the parts of the book that transcended into historical fiction to be the most compelling. This is not a book for everyone, but to  those for whom its themes have inherent appeal, it is a book to be relished.mselves up against obstacles placed in their way.

It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\"new\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\"Last Chance to See.\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\"extinct.\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\"last chance to see\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\"	2005-10-14

Politics has a role as well, and he must address the inherent contradictions within the Capitalist system that encourages capital accumulation, flight and waste. All in all and interesting read from an \\"insider\\"...if you are looking for alternatives to the \\"Washington Consensus\\" then this is not your book. This book mainly advocates tweeking the international system (IMF, World bank, UN) to help alleviate poverty (which has political as well as economic reasons) but not changing it per se. I would have hoped that he would have taken on more the Capitalist world system and its predictable modern expression of it and its future trajectory.	2005-10-14

In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story!	2005-10-14

The Aztec empire stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic costs of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom was found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America.  But this book considers the people of these regions to be a mosaic of tribes and nations so that most of the chapters are topical, talking about food and drink, religious life, masks, and such in terms of all of the cultures that apply.  There are a few specific chapters devoted to the Incas and their ancestors and Cities of the Andes, but most toss in everything together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find this approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean cultures that lumps Spain, Italy and Greece together with the likes of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In this volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltecs are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anything close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topics where it makes sense to talk about multiple cultures, such as the Human sacrifice by the Incas and Aztecs, but that does not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempted to get different colored highlighters and color code the three main cultures throughout the book so it is easier to make the connections.<br /><br />As always, the chief attraction of this Eyewitness Book is that it is filled with photographs of artifacts from museums around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasures made their way to Europe).  Most of us will never get to see a Toltec coyote warrior inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.

I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read.  <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her great aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of great characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus.  Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica.  The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia.  Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques.   <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny.  The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book.  <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book.

He is too ugly and broke to be able to seduce women and leave them feeling used.  I got this book from the library because as a single gal I thought that I would learn something about men,  the kind who charm,  seduce,  and destroy.  Well,  what I learned is that Rick Marin is just a talentless guy trying to pass himself off as an intropesctive writer-wannabe poser.  It's amazing that Marin got any girls to date him taking into consideration how cold and judgmental he is. Reading his book was like watching a car accident--you know it's better to control yourself but you keeping looking to see the blood and guts.  Well,  this book just shows that this guy,  who has really nothing special,  or even redeemable,  is striving to be funny, intellectual, and show the male perspective on dating. He comes off really shallow,  superficial,  and as though he doesn't care which girl he's with as long as he's not alone.  Read it for yourself--Marin has nothing new or interesting to write. In this day and age,  anyone can publish regardless of whether or not the writer has anything significant to write about.	2005-10-14

He then goes into their relationship, how it came to be, and the affect it had on their great works of literature. The books influenced by their time together, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Grant's Personal Memoirs, are considered to be classics and the best that either of the authors ever produced.  In fact, some think that Huckleberry Finn is the best American novel ever, and that Personal Memoirs (about the Mexican and Civil Wars) is the best American book ever written on military events.   Perry records many conversations Grant and Twain had with each other and with the other folks surrounding them, including families and associates.  It makes you feel like you are there, and gives some personal insight into what these gentlemen were really like. We find that they were both quite remarkable as private figures as well as public figures. The story of their relationship rides to a great extent on the heroic drama of Grant racing to finish his book before dying of cancer, to ensure the financial security of his family.  Perry, at the same time, paints a fascinating sketch of what Twain called the Gilded Age, a time of great industrial progress along with great corruption in the U.S. <br /> <br />It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. <br />	2005-10-14

In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico	2005-10-14

She visits his property to learn he has been gone for about a week.  Inside his dying plants show he has not been there.<br /><br />Worse a stranger is residing in Daniel's house insisting that he is a nephew interested in his family tree.  However, as the residences on Creek Road suffer a rash of odd break-ins, Emily notices that Matthew is paying more attention to her and her parents than the Rutherford family.  Emily wonders is he really a relative of her neighbor or is he the B&E bandit?  Regardless, she knows from the moment their eyes saw one another, something inside her heart clicked.<br /><br />The sequel to THE HOUSE ON CREEK ROAD is a fine romantic suspense thriller as Emily wonders whether her heart has betrayed her since the stranger seems to be \\"investigating\\" her family not his as he claims.  Matthew finds the conflict of interest even more difficult as he hides why he is in town from the woman he has fallen in love with though they hardly know one another.

Lucent's down fall started with the 1984 decree. Something that AT&T embraced thinking that new and bigger markets would be available. Missteps included buying TCI cable without the experience and knowledge of running a mom and pop business on the run far from \\"Bell Standards\\" that so many Western Electric and Lucent Managers embraced. They did not change into the flexible and savy business men of the 80s and 90s and lost at every turn and decission. The \\"Early Outs\\" prior to 1991 took most of the business knowledge and stability with them. Managers and CEOs were hired from all differnt kinds of Companies having differnt values and business understandings (which was needed) but lacked fundamental telecommunications expertise and how to gain a lion's share of the market. The best method was new technologies coupled with listening to all the customers needs and concerns. Lucent, like its predecessor and parent company, devalued it's stock and undevalued it's once talented, dedicated and loyal workforce. The Book seems like a good purchase but it doesn't seem to touch upon the employees who built it and subsequently were forced to see it go. Bell Labs and the Bell System literally dictated to the Baby Bells that analog equipment would continue to be used in the late 70s. Digital technology had been introduced by various venders and Bell Labs played \\"catch up\\" when the operating companies began buying the digital equipment fron non Western Electric sources. That was the first mis-step of Western Electric....Lucent Technologies management. Understand the marketplace and the needs of your customer...always. R.

There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />	2005-10-14

I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night.

I did not like the idea that instead of Tarl Cabot we were now telling the story of a different Earth man who ends up on Gor, although the Jason Marshall trilogy was more interesting to me than the story of Judy Thornton, a woman brought to Gor as a captive in \\"Slave Girl of Gor.\\"  In the first volume of the trilogy, \\"Fighting Slave of Gor,\\" Marshall ends up on Gor when he tries to save Beverly Henderson from a Gorean slave trap.  The next thing the civilized Earth man knows he is a slave on Gor.  Starting out as the silk slave of the Lady Florence of Vonda, Marshall then becomes a Gorean gladiator, which gives him the opportunity to become free so that he can find Beverly, who now also a slave on Gor.<br /><br />\\"Rogue of Gor\\" is the middle volume in the trilogy and the novel and has Marshall searching for Beverly.  But since this is a trilogy you know that he is not going to find her until the final volume, \\"Guardsman of Gor.\\"  Instead, Marshall travels along the River Vosk to the port city of Victoria, north of Port Kar, and finds himself in the middle of a war between Glorious Ar and the Salerian Confederation as the pirate fleet seeks to control the waterways of Gor on which the cities are so dependent.  In terms of providing more action than sex, this is the one volume of the trilogy that delivers on that score and if you are waiting for Jason and Beverly to consummate their relationship in Gorean terms you have the last half of the next novel for all of that to play out (after a giant naval battle).  In this one he finds her on the slaver's block, buys her, and sets her free even though she insists she is a true slave and therefore does not desire freedom.<br /><br />There is a sense in which Norman is trying to get back to the basics, since the fight between Ar and the Salerian Confederation is not, at face value, part of the gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.  But the sexual philosophy of Gor is now becoming the dominant theme of Norman's stories.  The back of the original paperback declares, \\"Jason Marshall learned the meaning of manhood and the power of women, both dominant and submissive\\" on Gor, but clearly he has yet to fully accept his role in this society.  This time around Norman is educating a male rather than a female, which is usually the case in the Gor novels, and I think that you have to take such instruction at face value.<br /><br />The obvious assumption might be that most men would not need to be persuaded to live a life being a master, but when you consider the discussion that Jason and Beverly were having at the start of the trilogy before they ended up on Gor you have to admit that it is not exactly the sort of lifestyle to which a \\"civilized\\" man would aspire.  Clearly Norman is arguing men have to be carefully taught such beliefs almost as much as women, although you will never convince me the male of the species would require as much persuasion.  Consequently, whether you judge \\"Rogue of Gor\\" by the standard of either the best Gor adventures (\\"Nomads of Gor\\" and \\"Assassins of Gor\\") or the main testaments of Gorean sexuality (\\"Slave Girl of Gor,\\" \\"Kajira of Gor,\\" and \\"Dancing Girl of Gor\\"), it falls short.  For the most part only true believers are going to proceed beyond this trilogy to complete the series.he gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.

Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

While I don't always agree with his TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford's commentaries. His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquoting of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadowing of the paraphrasing to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explaining the links between money and reporting and providing a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demanding a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tuning to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becoming customer-driven reinforcing agents. If that's true, why is the media making that choice instead of taking the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giving hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\" After 116 pages of caterwalling about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\"message,\\" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attacking the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choosing that one gains perspective and insight. Not voting because you're a journalist is like saying a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or deciding not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.

Author Murray was given unprecedented access to Lyric Opera of Chicago's Opera Center for American Artists during the 2003-2004 season. This is Lyric Opera's training ground for young artists. Murray follows this group of twelve singers through coaching sessions, rehearsals, auditions and performances to give the reader a close-hand look at the rigorous intensity of this most glorious art form. Interspersed with this are chapthers which fill out the picture of what it takes to succeed in opera. There is a chapter devoted to the comprimario - singers who specialize in secondary characters. Another chapter is devoted to Pavarotti, a warning of what can happen when one achieves what Murray dubs 'sacred monster' status. A sacred monster, superstar, Pavarotti was undone at the end of his career by his enormous ego. This book is a wonderful gift for those opera lovers on your Christmas list this season.	2005-10-14

Word to the wise. The Magic of Christmas is identical to Christmas Unwrapped and the X-mas Files by the same author. The publisher, for some unknown and absurd reason, republished this book under three different titles with three different publication dates.  <br /> <br />The overall theme of the book is excellent for showing the Amanita muscaria mushroom/shamanic origins of the Christmas story and even goes into some archaeoastronomy.  <br /> <br />Much of this same information has been revealed by James Arthur in Mushrooms and Mankind and by James Bursenos in The Resurrection of Santa Claus - (republished) Shaman's Drum Issue 68, 2005. Dr. Harding was probably the first to discover the information, and probably the last to go to print with it. James Arthur (2000) uses many of the same associations in his book (with no references - plagiarism?) and radio shows that he very likely took \\"some\\" material from Harding. Harding's book(s) are far better and more readable than James Highfield - The Physics of Christmas (1998), etc., which bases much of the work on Harding, though strays off numerous times into unrelated material. <br /> <br />However, save your money and only buy one of the 3 different versions of the book.

Being a stalwart fan of the fantasy genre I decided to put my skepticism aside, break down and give these \\"children's\\" books a go. This series is in line with a lot of classic entertainment touted as \\"children's\\" fare (e.g., original Bugs Bunny cartoons, The Hobbit, Chronicles of Narnia, among others): that is, much of it is aimed straight at the heart of adults. And it hits the mark.    I have finished the series up to Book Five and I must say that there have been some pretty grisly incidents for younger readers. However, one can assume that many of Rowling's younger readers have followed the books from the beginning, and grown as Harry Potter did. For the younger readers just starting, however, along about book four some of the material may be a tad startling or disconcerting.    In any case, I have found the writing to be thoroughly entertaining, particularly the effective use of tongue-in-cheek humor. There is a comical brattiness about many of the characters (professors, parents, and students alike) which plays pretty well. The childishness of the main characters can be a bit trying at times, I will admit; but it is forgivable and understandable...they are, after all, still kids.    The use of suggestion and mystery -- of questions that do not get answered till the end of the book -- can also be a bit trying at times, but it is also compelling and intriguing at the same time, and part of this author's trademark.    All in all, these are exciting, fast-paced books, truly classics in their own time, and I am duly impressed that they lived up to their hype in my mind, skeptic that I was. Five stars, for cripe's sake.	2005-10-14

This one is as good as all the others. Somehow she makes all her books feel \\"new\\" even though they have the same theme. They never get boring or tedious. Being a European myself, I like the way a lot of her plots revolve around European cities and countries. She aparently knows a lot about the places she write, and also a lot about antiquites and history. I am looking forward to her writing about Sweden some day. If you like her other books, this is a sure bet! I hope she will continue writing for many many years to come.	2005-10-14

Reflection over time, however, yields a few problems.  <br />As another reviewer has pointed out, Bryant uses a dispicable character to explain and augment the premise for the culture of Ata; many readers will find it hard to sympathize with his supposed enlightenment. Also, the id is completely glossed over in this book, the idea being that  proper socialization within such a  Utopian culture would erase or negate animalistic urges down to permanently manageable magnitude; many readers will question her conclusion in that regard and doubts will emerge on the entire premise. Lastly, the protagonists obtuse nature makes the book plod a bit; many readers will \\"get it\\" right away and be annoyed with how long it takes the main character to catch up (which in some respects he never really does) <br /> <br />Then there's the attitude of the Kin of Ata themselves. While beautiful and loving and empathic and yadda yadda, they can easily come across as lackadaisical or just plain apathetic. While much is made of their near-telepathic \\"oneness\\" and reliance upon their spiritual nature, their repeated indulgence of the main character becomes tiresome.... have they no self-preservation? No passion? No overriding discipline? These questions are best exemplified by the fact that the Ata see no benefit from the notion of the written word. Much is made of their connection to one another; their oral history that becomes the art of storytelling etc. Apparently, historical fact-keeping is anathema to Utopia. I found that notion to be impossible to accept. Within the framework of a people absolutely cut-off from \\"modern\\" societies influence perhaps that could MAYBE be true, but one does not simply dismiss an obstacle to spiritual awakening by pushing it out of view. This comes across as a basic ostrich manuever to avoid facing the difficult realities of human natures: heirarchical thinking, competiveness and basic surivival needs that when unmet turn to aggression and antagonistic behavior. Those may not be pleasant realities but they are realities. <br /> <br />For a more interesting (and possibly more intellectual) take on the same notion, try out Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Although her victorian attitudes about female sexuality date the piece, all other aspects of her Utopia seem more plausible to me. Which is saying something, really.  <br /> <br />Actually, I'd be more enthusiastic to recommend The Dispossessed (or nearly anything by Ursula K LeGuin) or Wild Seed (or nearly anything by Octavia Butler) as both (the books and the writers) explore the notion of a Utopian ideal by handing it to humanity via an alien race who are well aware of the not-so-nice aspects of human nature. Both writers understand that some unsavory elements are iron-clad stuck in us, not just taught to us.  <br /> <br />By keeping the Utopianists as human as anyone else, we beg the question \\"why do those humans never fight, never hurt each other and how would they deal with a natural disaster?\\" which never seems to be answered by Utopian writers adequately. By beginning enlightenment with an outside species/race, we change the question to \\"can humanity resist its negative tendancies in order to accept this Utopia?\\" which is imminently more interesting and quite possibly answerable on some level.  <br /> <br />The Kin of Ata... neither addresses nor firmly answers these questions, which is it's only flaw. For fantasy, however, it sure is a wonderful read.	2005-10-14

There were times as I was reading this book that I cringed and thought to myself \\"How could she be so stupid.\\" But I had to remind myself of her tender age in this story. She did a lot of things at a young age that many of us may never do in our entire lifetime. Prostitution, Pimping and drugs. This book had so much purpose and that's why I call it \\"One of the best book that I read all year\\". It's written like a novel so it doesn't come off preachy or like a self help book. Maya Angelou tells a portion of her story. She uncovers layers of clothing and bares the naked truth of her young adulthood. To me this is not just a story of a black woman and a black womans struggles; this is a story about hard knocks and people of all races and nationalities experience them. \\"Rita\\" felt like she had to make her own way, she felt like she needed all of the answers at once. No one was going to take care of her and son.  And at the same time, while she felt the burdens of independence, she also felt the emptieness and lonlieness that we all feel some time or another just because we are human. \\"Rita\\" made a lot of poor decisions, but that's not the reason that we know her today. We don't know her because she was once a madam on the West Coast, or a prostitute in Stockton, or a cook in Oakland. We know her because she found God's plan for her life and stuck with it.	2005-10-14

It heightened the anticipation that something major (and perhaps unpleasant) was going to unfold in this man's life. The story however started to lose my attention when it delved into the details of the surgical operations Dr Perowne was almost reminiscing about.    There are of course twists and turns in the story and spots of brilliancy.  However, the ambitiousness that underlies the writing of this novel permeates almost every sentence in the story, as a result of the contrived manner in which the story was weaved together.  One cannot help but feel that the story was written in such a manner as to overwhelm, and therefore, impress, a reader by means of employing semmingly non-intricate sub-plots.  Such sub-plots are by no means undesirable.  It is however rather lamentable when one is unable to weave the sub-plots together skillfully, as in \\"Saturday\\".    The only saving grace of \\"Saturday\\" was the incredibly insightful and masterly description of a character's thoughts and emotions, almost right down to every second of thought or emotion that went through the character.  Indeed, it was written so well that it starts to make one wonder whether one is actually capable of so many thoughts and emotions per second.  And that can be a rather startling, perhaps even disturbing, thought.  It seems to insinuate that perhaps one doesn't actually know oneself as well as one had thought one does.    But this is not an issue for anyone to ponder over for another day, especially if at least 1 day of the week has already been spent on \\"Saturday\\".  Your time would be better employed pondering on the remains of the week.	2005-10-14

I started reading Eye of the World a couple years ago and my own writing moved from really sucking to only mild suckage. If I could read all of the 8,000 pages I've heard are first presented for editing for each book, I would. I recommend reading each book twice. Once to read it over and know the plot, and the second time should be thorough to the point of anal-ness. This prepares you for discussion with the other members of our breed. <br /> <br />On the actual specific book. . . . <br />Overall, the plot moved forward at a pretty suitable pace. I am sad to see the world in a downward spiral to Tarmon Gai'don, but all good things must come to an end. I'm most happy with the advancements in character given to Mat, Tuon, Nynaeve, and Egwene. Mat's always been my favorite character, but Knife of Dreams really gave him yet another layer that was done really tastefully.  There is a Tuon POV, which helps build her, and she's fast gaining respect in my eyes.  There are a couple scenes with Nynaeve dealing with Lan that just made me tear up, but I really love those two! <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

I picked Mr. Huntington's book in the summer of 2005 and found it to be very enlightening. I find it undeniable the fact that at the origin of the success of America as a nation and a state lies her British, protestant origins. That origin set the tone of the work ethic, legal system, democratic representation. One can find further confirmation of this thesis in the splendid \\"The History of the American People\\" by British historian Paul Johnson. Samuel Huntington points out that until early sixties immigrants arriving in the USA were assisted by the government in their assimilation process. The English language instructions were easily available and no one found offensive the premise that the command of the english language was essential to fully function as an American. Since then, the \\"assimilation\\" became a bad word and government's assistance started to look like discrimination. These days, in the name of diversity and political correctness, any government program has a counter-assimilation effects. The bilingual education of Hispanics, for example, only postpones their entry into the English speaking world. Compare the fate of Hispanic youth receiving their education in Spanish with that of young children arriving from Eastern Europe, Russia or Asia. With no bilingual education available to those kids, their succesful transition into English speaking world is almost instantenous.    While discussing three major social theories, Mr. Huntington clearly makes a case for a \\"tomato soup with garnishings\\" model (with tomatos representing anglo-protestant core values with garnishings provided by non-anglo immigrant groups). Once hoped for, \\"melting pot\\" model, is not really happening. What seems to be happening, however, is that the rising cultural awareness of individual ethnic groups and lack of assimilation programs leads us towards a \\"tossed salad\\" type of a society.    The book raises reader's awarenes of the social procesess that take place. Unfortunately, it can only do just that. The sheer force of the sociodemographic change in the US is probably impossible to control and the anglo-protestant core of values will get dilluted and all but disappear.	2005-10-14
US	50774468	REYUKJGWI1EGL	0380007789	856556145	The Wolf and the Dove	Books	3	12	17	N	N	The most palpable Woodiwiss novel I have read (3 1/2 stars)...	Anything written by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss is a guilty pleasure for me. She writes bodice rippers with some rather cheesy storylines and language full of purple prose. In other words, her books are every romance novel clich&eacute; come to life. However, I still find them enjoyable to read. Guilty pleasures, as stated above. And I have enjoyed all of the novels I have read by her so far with the exception of The Flame and the Flower. The Wolf and the Dove is the most riveting Woodiwiss yet for me, right up there with A Rose in Winter. I am a sucker for Medieval romances and Woodiwiss does a fine job describing this time frame. This novel takes place during the rein of William the Conqueror King, in the year 1066. Wulfgar is a Norman warrior in charge of battling against the Saxons and claiming their lands and properties. Before he is able to arrive to Darkenwald, Ragnor, one of his underlings, gets there first, wreaking unnecessary havoc and killing a noble veteran Saxon warrior, leaving his wife Maida and his daughter Aislinn under the sadist's mercy. Ragnor takes advantage of Aislinn and destroys the lives of everyone in Darkenwald. Things take a disarming turn when Wulfgar arrives in Darkenwald, claiming the land as his own, and turning the Saxons into his slaves. He also decides to turn the beautiful, copper-haired Aislinn into his lover and personal slave. But he soon discovers that Aislinn is feistier and more spirited than most women and bending her to his will won't be easy. But as she is forced to bed the gorgeous, mysterious, women-hating warrior, she cannot help the passion he awakens in her and becomes determined to win his heart at all cost. There are many twists throughout this novel.<br /><br />I have to say that, unlike the other Woodiwiss novels I've read, the main characters in this novel have more depth and are more richly characterized. Wulfgar is an enigma -- a troubled and barbaric warrior with a dark personality that hides kindness, fairness and loneliness within. His hatred for women is understandable once you learn about his past. Aislinn is a fighter, a woman with a passionate, unyielding spirit, not your typical damsel in distress (though she is, in fact, a damsel in distress). This historical romance novel is rather dark. The times of William the Conqueror were barbaric times, and I'm sure that the horrible stuff Wulfgar, Ragnor and the other knights do in this novel pale in comparison to the real stuff that went on in those times. So using this time period as the backdrop for the story was rather risque. I have noticed that Woodiwiss likes to create flawed characters and situations. For the most part, I enjoyed the story and how realistic the protagonists' growth from lust to love is, but this novel is an infuriating roller coaster ride of emotions. I almost closed the book and put it in the trash when I read Wulfgar's appalling answer to Aislinn's news regarding her pregnancy. The man is infuriating and I found myself hating him for a large portion of the book. To me, he was the Shanna of this novel (read my review of Shanna and you'll see what I mean). His treatment of Aislinn is disgusting at times. The fact that I knew he was denying his growing feelings for Aislinn and her determination to obtain him kept me hopeful. But the main problem with this novel is how repetitious it is. For about two-hundred pages, we get this: 1) Wulfgar joins Aislinn in bed and pretty much forces her to have sex with him. 2) Gwyneth, Wulfgar's sister, pouts, yells and calls Aislinn every derogatory name in the world. 3) Wulfgar and Aislinn have arguments in which he mocks her or behaves like a total jerk and she gets angry and insults him. 4) Ragnor swears revenge against Wulfgar. 5) Ragnor hits on Aislinn and tries to rape her, and someone rescues her in the nick of time. Lather, rinse and repeat.<br /><br />I hate to skip pages when I read a book, but I had to, for it was the only way I could avoid so much redundancy. After I skipped almost one-hundred pages, I discovered that I hadn't missed a thing. The novel is too long-winded, unnecessarily so. Also, I agree with the reviewers who say that Aislinn adjusted to the untenable living situation with unrealistic easiness. The way she adjusts to her ordeal is not unlike someone with Stockholm Syndrome. Ech! And there are, of course, the signature Woodiwiss word repetitions. The woman seems to be obsessed with mentioning the characters' eyebrows. The word \\"eyebrow\\" is in almost every paragraph. And was it just me, or did Aislinn spend the entire novel blushing with embarrassment? Other than that, this is the best Woodiwiss offering I have read so far. It supplied the entertainment that I craved. I recommend The Wolf and the Dove for the brain candy entertainment that it is.cy.

I'm glad she admits that this family history is part imagination, as befits a 'historian,' as her preface is three years past the publication date (Jan. 15, 2008).  This very obvious discreptancy makes the reader wonder if the other dates are factual or have been changed to protect some- one or -thing.  Implying that there could be a modern Dracula based on the legend of Vlad the Impaler, some one of her ancestors, this is total fantasy. <br /> <br />The map of \\"Cold War Europe\\" is revealing with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (which no longer exists), United Kingdom (never united but warring), Corsica, west of Italy, Sicily, east of the boot's toe, Poland (Hello, Victor Ashe), France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands, Albania, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Romania, Czechoslavakia, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Crete, and Sardinia (now called the United States of Europe).   <br /> <br />A few years ago, Nick Clooney had a book released about the movies that changed us.  I asked him on the phone early one morning that December which movie changed him; and he replied, \\"Dracula.\\"  This has to be the book for him.  Is it possible for the Dracula of myth to have truly existed?   <br /> <br />First, Professor Rossi, then his heir to the family history, search for clues in such faraway places as Budapest, Istanbul and Eastern Europe (the East bloc).  Were there any such evil ancestor of mine, besides the Black Prince of England, I wouldn't want to know.  I certainly would not put myself in danger by delving into the 'dirty linen' in everybody's family history.  The rogues are the most interesting; the first cousin I thought was so handsome was a murderer  -- went to prison twice for killing two men over 'a woman.'  My dad was afraid of that good-looking (but evil on the inside) nephew, and he had reason to live in fear.  Before he died, it was my pleasure and privilege to tell him that Ed had already died.  He didn't believe me.  Sometimes, fear can take over your entire life. <br /> <br />Father & daughter shared hot tea (with lemon) and sardines at a teahouse as he warns her about his quest concerning the truth of their ancestry.  He told her stories; he wrote letters; he kept files full of his research, and a book, DRAKULA, about the feudal lord, Vlad Tepes, a cruel personage people called Bella Lugoisi, Dracula.  She writes as if this were autobiography and it had taken place in Romania.   <br /> <br />After her father's death, she went on her own search for their past.  This tale \\"blends fact and fantasy, history and the present.\\"  Elizabeth Kostova was educated in the USA at Yale and the University of Michigan, but writes this book in Oxford, England.   \\"The more distant history within this story I have researched as carefully as I would any academic test.  There is a final resource to w hich I've resorted when necessary -- the imagination.\\"  All modern historians do.	2005-10-14

Satch Carlson was born in a small California town that even now refuses to admit it.

His formative years were spent in Reno (where he learned the rules of blackjack and social decorum). In 1967 he moved to Anchorage, Alaska, to pursue the murder of trout and salmon and other living things, and found himself graduating from Alaska Methodist University two years later.

Ross Perot, there has been a growing awareness in American politics and society of the financial burden Social Security amd Medicare will have on future generations.  This book is one of several to examine this issue and to propose solutions for it.   <br /> <br />In short, this book explains how the demographic changes occurring within the US will make Social Security and Medicare very expensive for future generations to pay for.  Specifically, as the ratio of workers to retirees gets smaller and smaller, each worker will have to contribute more and more of his/her income to provide for the benefits of the retiree.  This book clearly illustrates this problem, and with some simple math, explains how this problem grows bigger with time.  The book also looks at some of the possible and proposed solutions to this problem.  These include raising the eligibility age for benefits, raising social security taxes, eliminating benefits for people above a certain income level, etc...   The book examines the pros and cons of each of these suggestions, and their efficacy and political viability.   <br /> <br />The book also forecasts what might happen to the US economy if Social Security is not reformed and how the govt might finance itself.  Overall, a good book to read.	2005-10-14

So I also asked to proofread \\"Dawn of a Thousand Nights: A Story of Honor.\\" Again, I was definitely NOT disappointed! I literally had to MAKE myself slow down so I could proofread carefully! I was hooked from the first page. It's definitely a 5-star book--a fascinating read, sad because of Pearl Harbor & other elements but also hopeful. It also takes place in WWII. We are there at Pearl Harbor; we are there with the women fliers (WAFS/WASPS) who transported planes across the country to free up male pilots for the war (one of the aspects of WWII I didn't know about until this book). We are also there in the Philippines, including the Bataan Death March & the horrid Japanese POW camps. Yet even through some of the worst circumstances of the war, this gifted author shows us that God truly cares & loves each of His children, & He can & will bring victory out of defeat. Such a powerful message of hope, love, & grace!       Historical figures are included, but the fiction & history mesh well. Readers even get to \\"see\\" from a Japanese point of view. The characters are compelling; I couldn't wait to know what happened to them! There is a touch of romance, but it's not overdone. This book is much more about the history, the people who lived it, and what they experienced during WWII. It's packed with emotions from those historical events: realism, fear, hope, faith, & love in the midst of extremely difficult times...& the gamut of emotions those who lived through WWII experienced. This is truly a unique and compelling book with characters who have depth & conflicts; I felt like I was there in each of the three main character's minds. Each of the chapters starts with actual historical newspaper excerpts, which adds a unique realism not always found in novels.      I have proofed well over 600 books, & I write reviews on VERY few. But Tricia Goyer's books are, quite simply, excellent!I have not found another author like her, and I am immensely thankful that I got to work on this book. I had to have \\"Night Song,\\" and since I didn't get to proof that, I bought it. Even though \\"Dawn\\" may seem like a long book, it's well worth your time! I love historical books that I can \\"sink my teeth into\\"--ones that have depth and a great story mixed with history--not short, shallow books that only use history as a backdrop or setting.     This book was my jumping-off place to learn more about the war in the Pacific & the Bataan Death March. If you love WWII historical novels, you won't be able to put this book down! It has stayed with me since May 2004! Don't miss this! I'm so glad I didn't. :-)     I've already asked the publisher if I can proofread Tricia Goyer's next book. I can hardly wait! :-) I cannot recommend   this book highly enough! Enjoy!	2005-10-14

Also, Mazzone defends his coaching philosophies which include the practice of throwing in between starts, getting the pitcher's input on how long he stays in the game, his aversion to the \\"wild card\\" format and emphasis on pitch location rather than raw power. Of course, the good coach in him refuses to dwell on the Braves' postseason failures but instead celebrates the team's successes.<br /><br />Having said that, I would have liked him to make the book just a little bit longer by rating the current aces (Randy Johnson, Bartolo Colon) and sluggers (Barry Bonds, David Ortiz) and of course another chapter on the post-Maddux, Glavine era would have made the book perfect.<br /><br />Even if pundits scoff at his team's postseason failures, I do believe real baseball enthusiasts including opposing players and coaches have a healthy respect for his and Cox's ability to mold a staff and in effect a team.	2005-10-14

But the greatest threat to Abramm and the realm is a creature born of sorcery and malice, blood-bonded to Abramm himself, created to destroy him and open the way for dark forces to control the throne of Kiriath through his younger brother. <br /> <br /> At this point, especially after re-reading the story, I've lost all objectivity about Karen Hancock's writing, or her stories, and have become a total fangirl. Though many other CBA authors have been compared to J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, none others have come so close to matching the scope and wonder of these two classic, beloved authors. I was thoroughly drawn into this segment of the tale and found my affections unexpectedly engaged not only by Abramm himself, all over again, but various secondary characters-Uncle Simon, Lady Madeleine, and the boy servant, Jared. More depth is given to Abramm's twin sister Carissa, as she must face her lingering rancor over Abramm's spiritual decisions. And the crowning point of the book is a marvel of love, faith, and the power of true fellowship. <br /> <br /> It's no surprise that The Shadow Within won the author her third Christy award for the third year in a row. Along with other dedicated Hancock fans, I wait with bated breath for Shadow Over Kiriath, the next installment of the four-part Legends of the Guardian King, due out November 2005. <br />	2005-10-14

That being so, you'll probably want to read other reviews than mine.  This is in principle a good idea; but having just read all of them (147 at the time of writing) I should warn you that you'll need both considerable stamina and a strong stomach: there are indeed thoughtful and informative reviews, but they are islands in a sea of drivel.  By &#34;drivel&#34; I mean the following:<br /><br />1) Reviews consisting entirely (or almost entirely) of expostulation rather than information (&#34;racist garbage&#34;, &#34;most important book of the 20th century&#34;)<br /><br />2) Asserting what the book doesn't deny and denying what it doesn't assert.<br /><br />3) Distortions of the book's content, and other disinformation, for instance:<br /><br />  - &#34;the panel criticized the authors for not explaining what intelligence is&#34; (intelligence is defined on page 4 (!) ).<br /><br />  - &#34;The Bell Curve ignores bad diet&#34; (Nutrition is explicitly dealt with on pp. 391-3).<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />Many of the critics appear not merely to have misunderstood the book, but not even to have read it; amusingly, this is actually admitted in one review (&#34;Although Head has only browsed through the book, she has seen this kind of pseudo-science before&#34;).  Some appear to be basing their argument upon the Moralistic Fallacy: if different groups had different average IQs for even partially genetic reasons, it would be a Bad Thing, and therefore that cannot possibly be the case.<br /><br />(It also follows, naturally, that there's no need to examine the evidence, because the correct outcome is known in advance; and also that those who think otherwise must be making factual and/or logical errors, either unconsciously or consciously, making them fools in the former case and fascists in the latter.)<br /><br />For myself, I found this a strange book in some ways, but only one other reviewer (Jennifer Kerns, I think the name was) touched on the reason.  And that is that the book falls logically into three parts, which by their very nature are of varying reliability.<br /><br />The first, and by far the largest, covers the available evidence on IQ and heredity.  The second and third parts extrapolate present trends to the future (with unpleasant consequences) and make policy recommendations to deal with these projected consequences.  Thus almost by definition these are on shakier ground.<br /><br />- The first section, which excited by far the most controversy, is (ironically), easily on the firmest ground scientifically — as confirmed (for example) by an American Psychological Association task force explicitly set up to investigate it*; and by a letter to the Wall Street Journal by fifty-two leading psychometricians, a copy of which can be found on the Net (&#34;Mainstream Science on Intelligence&#34;, also reprinted as an appendix in H.J. Eysenck's [[ASIN:156000360X Intelligence: A New Look]]).<br /><br />It seems to me a very able summary: it defines its terms, states its assumptions, produces its evidence and argues the merits of the various theories purporting to explain it.  So there's no need for you to take my word (or anyone's) as to whether the thesis is justified; the evidence and the arguments are both there; if you're capable of rational thought, you should be able to decide for yourself.  And this is what I advise you to do.<br /><br />- The second part envisages the potential stratification of society by intelligence into a hereditary &eacute;lite and underclass.  Here the authors start to part company with some (at least) of the aforementioned psychometricians.  Eysenck, for instance — certainly in the &#34;hereditarian&#34; camp as regards IQ — writes of an earlier article in Atlantic Monthly:<br /><br />&#34;Here Herrnstein is definitely beginning to run off the rails in his predictions (...) he disregards the importance of regression, the genetic factor which causes children of very bright and very dull parents to regress towards the mean of the whole population (...) [R]egression makes it quite impossible that castes should be created which will breed true — that is, where the children will have the same IQ as their parents.  Within a few generations, the differences in IQ between the children of very bright and very dull parents will have been completely wiped out.&#34; ([[ASIN:091273616X The Inequality of Man]], pp.213-219)<br /><br />Richard Lynn, however, disagrees, pointing out that if regression operated in all cases, then dog-breeding, and indeed evolution as a whole, would be impossible.<br /><br />- The third part, the policy recommendations, is well outside my area of competence, so I offer no comment.<br /><br />I should, however, like to make one further comment on other reviews, those containing the recommendation: &#34;People wanting an honest scientific analysis of the claims of racial superiority should read Stephen Jay Gould's [[ASIN:0393314251 The Mismeasure of Man]]&#34;.<br /><br />Gould's writing certainly has many admirable qualities, but honesty and scientific impartiality are not conspicuous among them — for specifics, see (for example)  Chapter 3 of John L. Casti's [[ASIN:0380711656 Paradigms Lost]]. Or see J. Philippe Rushton's review of &#34;Mismeasure&#34;, or Arthur Jensen's review (&#34;The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons&#34;), or John B. Carroll's, all of which you can find on the Web.<br /><br />I've been following the debate over IQ for 40 years, and [[ASIN:0393314251 The Mismeasure of Man]] has more factual errors per page than any book I've ever read.<br /><br />For a critical but still rational review of Herrnstein & Murray, I suggest Thomas Sowell's from American Spectator, which can also be found on the Web (&#34;Ethnicity and IQ&#34;).<br /><br />If you want a balanced account of the IQ field, try [[ASIN:0330263994 Intelligence: The Battle for the Mind]], half of which is written by H.J.

They kill their prey when they feed, so for me they have no redeeming graces no matter how polite, handsome, sexy, etc that they are.  I really did not want to read more than the first few pages, but since I spent so much money on this very short novella, I thought I could probably stand to finish it.  I found the writing less than spectacular also.  The descriptions and scenes seemed to be written in an amateur fashion, so I could not think of the characters as \\"real.\\"  The two main characters fell in love so quickly that I had to read the page again to be sure I had gotten it correct.  Nia was ready for Seth to make a move on her before he even came in the door.  Others may like this sort of approach, but I need some buildup for the relationship to ring true.  While I did like the mixed race content, the rest of it left me cold.  Killer vampires are just not my cup of tea and I could care less if they meet their mates and live happily ever after.  Just think of how many people over the centuries had their lives cut short so that these vampires could continue their existence. Even Nia's friend Imani is killed in the first three pages of the story.  What more can I say.	2005-10-14

I hung on to the book for several years and then, one hurricane week, without electricity and no work, I lit a candle and sat down to read ORENDA.  It has become one of my favorite books. Steeped in history, with a tale so compelling that I almost couldn't bear to finish it, I rushed out and bought all the other Kate Cameron (a.k.a. Beverly McGlamry) books I could find.  She is a writer of inestimable talent.  Her tale, while fictional, is woven within the tight constraints of factual history, so there are moments of gruesome reality. But this is juxtapositioned against a story of beauty, family, land and loss.  You needn't be particularly interested in the saga of the Iroquois Nation (on which this book is based) but I promise that you will be drawn in as easily as I was, to a world I never knew about.  This is a story beautifully told, of great moments and tragic ones, all exquisitely written with the true hand of a master historian.	2005-10-14

The United States has made some fundamental changes in its foreign policy as a result of the 9/11 attacks. These largely center around the almost unilateral decisions to change the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States had the power to do this, and exercised that power.  <br /> <br />It appeared unlikely that the US would get UN approval or a UN based coalition to work together. France and Russia were getting favorable oil pricing from Iraq in exchange for weapons and would likely veto any decision in the Security Council. The addition of numerous Islamic states into the General Assembly. So the decision was made to proceed anyway. It was certainly popular with the American people still operating in great anger after 9/11.  <br /> <br />Americans tend to believe with an almost religious fervor that our way is best, that the America system (under God) is clearly the way that the world should work. Americans believe that their global actions are benevolent, that the rest of the world is almost child like, and should look up to us as a father.  <br /> <br />The rest of the world doesn't exactly agree. The Islamic countries look at the US support of Israel and see a contempt for Islam. Europe looks at the US with some alarm. President Bush is often viewed as some kind of pistol packing Texas cowboy.  <br /> <br />Any book like this is a snapshot of the situation at a given time as seen by one person, the author. He certainly presents an interesting fview of other states worred about US dominance and who are starting to turn their concerns into action.  <br /> <br />It's an interesting book to read now, and it will be interesting to read in ten years or so to see just how a good a predictor Dr. Walt turns out to be.	2005-10-14

Fortunately, since the exploration is pretty hit-or-miss for me, the Seattle library has a lot of them (including this one), so I am able to preview them.  For my taste, The Second Half of Life is better in its intention than its execution.  Overall, for my money, a more successful work (also available both at Amazon and the Seattle library) is A Woman's Spiritual Retreat: Teaching, Meditations, and Rituals to Celebrate Your Authentic Feminine Wisdom, by Joan Borysenko.  Although it focuses primarily on women's wisdom and growth, as opposed to second-half-of-life wisdom and growth, it hits a lot of the same notes and also draws on myth and ritual.  (Another, much shorter work in a similar vein that I also found more successful is the meditation CD, Celtic Spirit Meditations, by Mara Freeman--also available at Amazon and reviewed by me here.)     Certainly, the intention of The Second Half of Life is to help people do some positive growth in their later years, drawing on wisdom of many cultures, and as the positive reviews attest, it does accomplish this very well for some people.  However, for me, Ms. Arrien picks some good myths, tales and themes for her foundation, but then doesn't do enough substantive and rigorous work with them.  The basic pattern (except for the Preferential Shapes exercise, see below) is to tell a tale or introduce a character or concept, give her interpretation (which often seems either too simplistic and schematic or too arbitrary, as other reviewers have noted), and then to say, \\"So where am I with __________ in my life?\\" [Fill in the blank with the theme or symbol just discussed.] The psychologizing offered, although constructive, seems--well, mostly self-evident.  To someone who grew up loving much of the original source material in its pure, story form, some of the interpretations actually diminish the stories'inherent symbolic meaning.      I did find both the description and the interpretation of the Nine Muses pretty good, and was pleased to come across a theme I'd been looking for but hadn't found elsewhere (except in Layne Redmond's wonderful music CD Invoking the Muse, also available on Amazon).  The Pandora's Box story has an interesting comparison of this myth in different cultures (including what was left in the bottom of the box, according to the different cultures).  The Preferential Shapes section gives you something specific to do, an exercise with your preferences for five universal shapes. I found this exercise to provide some helpful insights, albeit in a fortune-telling kind of way.  The 12 Labors of Hercules got a retelling that was somehow both cursory and redundant, and the interpretations here felt especially arbitrary and forced to me.  Like another reviewer, I found the Eight Gates rather suspect in how Ms. Arrien drew together elements supposedly from many sources to arrive at this particular interpretation (and I also could have done without the gnomes!), although there is some good material about initiation and transition here.  Overall, there seems to be a lot of focus on schematic, numbered, arbitrary hierarchies.     I also found the material overall to be too repetitive and slow-moving, and like another reviewer with the same problem, was irked by the verbal delivery (the uneven rhythm, the tone, and a tendency to do repetitions of phrases that did not feel naturally emphatic and became quite irritating).  It would be nice if Amazon would provide not only the Search Inside This Book function for books on tape (sadly missing here), so that people can get an idea of the specific content and tone, but also audioclips for books on tape, as they do for music CDs.  These audiocassettes are often quite pricey, and long, and one's personal reaction to the voice of the narrator is pretty important.  The Sounds True website does have audio samples formany of their authors' items, including this one.	2005-10-14

I just have to say that AH is a superior dictionary for everyday use.     I work for companies that maintain online dictionaries, and am, among other things responsible for comparing the contents of these lists with the latest published dictionaries to ascertain which entries should be deleted and which new ones included. I find that AH very rarely has bad judgement with respect to selection of entries.     Perhaps the reason another reviewer didn't find Carl Gauss or Reimann is because their names are actually Karl Gauss and Riemann. And I appreciate the fact that AH has gone a long way toward rectifying the perception conveyed by most older biographical dictionaries that all great people have been white, European and male. We need Gauss in there of couse, but we also need Robeson and St. Vincent Millay who won a Pulitzer Prize just like Frost, and who wrote just as beautifully.     Its goal obviously is to both be a desktop dictionary in a single volume, and yet include the words that educated American speakers are likely to encounter in modern, non-technical publications. (And yes, it is an American dictionary, which is why colour is defined as 'Chiefly British, variant of color'.) This objective becomes harder and harder to achieve as the base of English-speaking people expands, and the Internet makes so many more things available to the average reader. The average person may use words like 'alacrity' less often than they did 200 years ago, but in point of fact, the average person's active vocabulary is expanding.     I prefer the way they organize their word senses to what Webster does. (I never compare things to the OED, because that is a work of art, deserving of veneration.) It reserves entirely new entries for an entirely unrelated sense. AH will give iris(flower) and iris(of the eye) two different senses, but Webster's gives (though not entirely consistently) the nominal and verbal senses of, say, 'claim' entirely different entries. AH includes them under the same entry, because they are semantically very closely related.     The etymological Appendix of AH is also kind of famous among linguists. They have very nicely systematized and cross-referenced their entries against their hypothesized Indo-European roots. It's quite well researched, and also a lot of fun.	2005-10-14

For example, the human mind is excellent at recognizing patterns in things...to such a degree that we find many patterns in things which are actually random.  Another bias is the basic tendency to be accepting of evidence which is consistent with our belief but subjecting contradictory evidence to more careful scrutiny.  I have heard the explanation that chronic gamblers tend to relive their wins and block out their losses.  In actual fact, they dwell on the losses a lot more than the wins.  If so, why do they continue not only to gamble, but believe that they are better at it than they really are?  The answer is that their wins are almost always viewed as due to talent and many of the losses are re-categorized as \\"near wins.\\" (\\"If not for that field goal in the last seconds of the game, I would have won\\"--much more so than the corresponding \\"I almost lost that one, but they kicked a field goal at the end of the game and saved it for me.\\")  The first 125 pages cover six different types of bias (and variations of them). <br /> <br />The last third of the book analyzes three cases (alternative medicine, social interaction strategies, & ESP) where there is a lot of belief which is not supported by evidence.  These help a lot in making the ideas from the first part more concrete.	2005-10-14

I thought of several different ways in which to begin this review - several witty comparisons that would surely catch the reader's attention. But that was a month and a half ago. See, I started reading Blue Like Jazz on the 20th of July and it is now the 4th of October. I have four pages left and I'm not sure I have the strength to continue.    For you see: Donald Miller is wearying. Endlessly self-amused and self-absorbed, he seems to want nothing so much as to be hip, cool, edgy (despite his own protests that hip, edgy, and cool are vanities and wastes of time and energy). And if four years of highschool taught me anything, it is that everyone with a heart is thoroughly and deeply embarrassed when the Very Not Cool Guy walks in and tries to be cool. Think: The Offspring's \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy.\\"    The thing is: Christianity cannot be cool. There is no reason non-believers should see Christianity as anything even on the same plane as Cool. Christianity says and believes terrifying things about the non-believer. Forget the homosexuals a minute - Christianity says that the friendly, tax-paying, socially-active, community-leading paragon of virtue who doesn't bow the knee to Christ is horribly wicked and an actual enemy of God. No matter how kind and cool they are. For Christianity to become cool, it has to stop having anything to do with Christ and his message. Maybe Donald Miller wants that. It kinda seems like it, but who can say - since he's not that great at expressing anything beyond his own meandering and fleeting feelings on matters.    About two-thirds into the book, a friend (who won't receive an identity via nickname, such as Tony the Beat Poet or Andrew the Protester) asked me what kind of a book it was. I had a hard time describing it at first. Then I realized: \\"OMG!! I'm reading a blog on paper! LOL!!\\" Really, Miller's book is nothing more than a glorified blog in its meandering promise to get to a point that never comes. In reality, Miller wouldmake a much better blogger than he does a writer. Unfortunately, even as a blogger, he would only be so good - because despite moments of value and bits that come close to insight, his style is heavy-handed and obvious for too much of the book's 240 pages (I know, only 240 pages and it's taken me almost two-and-a-half months!).     One good-but-obvious point Miller makes throughout the book is that the human expression of Christianity in the contemporary American church is lacking at best, gravely flawed at worst, but most likely, somewhere in between. This is clearly true. But also clearly known to probably most of us. And the real problems are not often the ones that Miller is pointing out - he seems frequently upset at how little the church fits in with a world filled with lovely sinners. Yet still, there is value in his critique.    But not much. Again Miller shows himself to be like too many bloggers; and like too many bloggers, he has much criticism and too few answers. If he were a blogger, this might be acceptable; after all, the only cost associated with reading a blog is time (and perhaps mental health). A book, however, is paid in currency. There is real loss if a book does not measure up to its published value - and Blue Like Jazz does not. I hate to say that because there are a few amusing stories and I get the feeling the book wants to be useful - but it just isn't.	2005-10-14

I enjoyed Margaret Creighton's book.  From far off Yarmouth, Maine, she has thrown her nets far and wide and hauled in a lot of historical flotsam and jetsam that might have escaped other scholars, in service of putting together another of her finely tuned historical studies of the underserved in American history.  Here we find out more about the immigrant populations who comprised the Union Army, as well as the actual lives of the women of Gettysburg and the black citizens of the surrounding area.  These are the shadow puppets of history, the folks who you might never have learned about by visiting the national park nor studying your social studies book.<br /><br />You probably heard more about Mamie Eisenhower's residence at Gettysburg than you did about the women who were drafted into battle, whether they were forced to nurse, to cook, to slave, or to fight.  Why is this?  Partially, as Professor Creighton explains, these women were told, and they believed it, that their sacrifices did not matter.  And that, perhaps, there was even something a little bit shameful about what they did, particularly if they were required to assist the invading Confederate army.  Of the ravishment and rape that undoubtedly occurred, we know little but can surmise much, thanks to Creighton's research and the guarded testimony of forty Gettysburg women, mostly farmwives.  Creighton looks at the nuance behind every statement, searching out human reality wherever it crops it head.  \\"A middle-aged woman on a farm opened her door to a soldier on July second.  By the way he was dressed, she was sure that he was a Louisiana Tiger.  He told her that `General Lee had said that they should ask for food and if they would not give it they should demand it and that was what he was going to do.'  She fed him ham.  He ate some of it and then insulted her.  The bread, he complained, was not fit to eat,  `Madam,' he said, `I can go into any cabin in Virginia, poor and desolate as it is, from Winchester to Richmond, with not a fence standing, and get a better dinner than this.'\\"  Creighton returns to this anecdote to eke out perceptions on the nature of resistance, and the implacability of the bad ham (Gettysburg women had to be fine actresses, for otherwise the Tiger in question might have guessed that the farmwife had fine chickens hidden with their beaks taped.)<br /><br />As Creighton acknowledges, the presence of women on the Gettysburg battlefield is currently a contested site for scholars, particular feminist scholars, and she acknowledges that a host of others are trawling the same fields.  The material remains of interest, and does indeed widen our picture of what happened that summer long ago, but I wondered, after finishing the book, if perhaps she might have written three separate books, for there's a sense in which the struggles of the immigrant soldiers, the Gettysburg women, and the freed, escaped or citizen slaves are experiences of very different registers and don't mesh together especially well except under cloudy language of the deracinated and ignored, and although Creighton tries her best, she can only link them this vaguely for the first two hundred times, then after that her rhetoric grows tiresome.ter to Richmond, with not a fence standing, and get a better dinner than this.'\\"  Creighton returns to this anecdote to eke out perceptions on the nature of resistance, and the implacability of the bad ham (Gettysburg women had to be fine actresses, for otherwise the Tiger in question might have guessed that the farmwife had fine chickens hidden with their beaks taped.) <br /> <br />As Creighton acknowledges, the presence of women on the Gettysburg battlefield is currently a contested site for scholars, particular feminist scholars, and she acknowledges that a host of others are trawling the same fields.

The Autobiography of Ramtha's life <br />Part 2.  The Fundamental concepts of the teachings. <br /> <br /> <br />The Introductory Essay describes the background to Ramtha's teachings and highlights their uniqueness.  Not only do they address the fundamental questions of our origins and nature, but they deliver a comprehensive legacy of knowledge based on pure reason and science.  Coupled with this, are disciplines which give the student a means to experience and verify the philosophical aspects of the teachings, thus consolidating the knowledge as their own wisdom and personal truth. <br />Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE) is likened to the ancient mystery schools of Egypt, Greece and Persia.  As a school, it provides the fertile ground in which the student can expand and liberate their mind from their old indoctrinations and find their freedom through the exploration of their spiritual nature. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 1 <br />Ramtha the Enlightened One talks of his life 35,000 years ago and what led him to become a great warrior and conqueror.  He describes his recovery after being run through by a sword which led to his own self mastery and final ascension in front of his 2 million strong army. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 2 <br />Ramtha discusses our origins from the Void, the creation of time and the eventual evolution of the human form.  He describes the nature of God - the Observer and how reality is formed.  In addition, he explains how the brain works, the electromagnetic field around the body and how we can change.  He also addresses the concept of hope and the problems we experience with doubt and how every thought we have is constantly shaping our reality <br /> <br /> <br />This is a fabulous book for anyone seeking answers to these fundamental questions.  Itis especially complementary with many of the popular quantum physics books such as The Self Aware Universe by Amit Gotswami, The Field by Lynne McTaggart or Parallel Universes by Fred Alan Wolf. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

DO NOT BE FOOLED AS I WAS! I ordered this study guide in preparation for the ASE tests that I was going to be taking this fall.  This guide is very poorly put together and NOT EVEN PROOFREAD apparently...it's a complete joke!  Let me give you a few examples of why this is a HUGE waste of your money. <br /> <br />First of all, as you may or may not already know the ASE test questions are copyrighted and therefore CANNOT be reproduced.  This means that the \\"sample questions\\" in this guide are not ACTUAL ASE questions, but rather questions that the author of the book made up that are designed to be similar in style to the ones you would see on a real ASE exam.  ALL study guides are this way, which is fine so long as the person making up the questions is somewhat competent...the person who wrote this book IS NOT COMPETENT.  Many of the questions are quite misleading, and some of the answers are just plain wrong! EVEN according to the information that THEY THEMSELVES give in the study guide! <br /> <br />There are so many typo's and mistakes in this book I got the feeling I was reading a book report written by my 3rd grade sister.   <br /> <br />Each sample question is SUPPOSEDLY linked (by way of a reference number with a corresponding section) back to the section that explains how to do the procedure from which the question was based.  THERE WERE SEVERAL SAMPLE QUESTIONS THAT LINKED BACK TO A SECTION IN THE BOOK THAT DIDN'T EVEN EXIST!!!!! I mean, how frustrating is that! <br /> <br />And then there is this hoopla that they sell you on about having \\"explanations for each sample question telling why the correct answer is right as well as why the wrong answers are wrong.\\"  WHAT A QUACK!  A typical example of one of the sample questions and their \\"detailed explanation\\" for it would go something like this: <br /> <br />Question: <br />Technician A says [blah, blah, blah]. Technician B says [yada yada yada]. Who is correct? <br /> <br />a. Technician A <br />b. Technician B<br />c. Both Technicians A and B are correct <br />d. Neither Technician A or B is correct <br /> <br />Explanation: <br />a. The correct answer is a. \\"technician A is correct\\" <br />b. Answer B is not correct: [restates what technician B said WORD FOR WORD here] is not correct. [WHAT THE CRAP KIND OF EXPLANATION IS THAT???????!!!!!!] <br />c. Answer C is not correct because technician B is incorrect. <br />d. Answer D is not correct because technician A is correct. <br /> <br />WOULD THIS NOT FRUSTRATE YOU TOO WITH YOUR TESTS FAST APPROACHING? <br /> <br />Anyway, the first ASE study guide that I bought was a MITCHELL1 series study guide....after becoming very frustrated at the quality of the study guide I decided to purchase a different brand, so I went with the DELMAR series study guide and MUCH TO MY DISMAY when it arrived I found that it was THE EXACT SAME BOOK as the MITCHELL1!!!!  BUYERS BEWARE!!! Apparently DELMAR learning bought out MITCHELL, as well as CHILTON repair books companies and now has some sort of monopoly on the whole market.  It's sickening really...not because of the monopoly so much, but because DELMAR puts out such horrible products.   <br /> <br />Anyway, I just thought I would give you all the heads up so you do not make the same mistake I did....when I bought the book there were no reviews on it so after my experience I thought SOMEBODY needs to expose this JUNK for what it is.  I would put the company out of business if I could.  DO everyone a favor...spread the word around that DELMAR does NOT sell good products!  <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

In his foreword to the third edition, Aitken Roshi stated:   <br /> <br /> \\"this revised edition . . .now includes many new translations and studies of Dogen, and thus it is most welcome. Dogen wrote at the outermost edge of human communication, touching with every sentence such mysteries as self and other, self and non-self, meditation and realization, the temporal and the timeless, forms and the void.@He wrote of the attitude necessary for understanding, of the practice required. . .of the various insights that emerge, and of the many pitfalls. He did not generally write for beginners - most of his points require very careful study and a few of them elude almost everybody. These challenges are compounded by his creative use of the Japanese language. It has been said that he wrote in \\"Dogenese,\\" for he made verbs of nouns, nouns of verbs, created new metaphors, and manipulated old sayings to present his particular understanding. . . \\"  <br /> <br /> Prof. Kim's study has been based on a careful reading of Dogen's chosen idioms. He has endeavoured to amplify Dogen's understanding of 'do-ri' - or 'reason of the way.' Kim is keen to show that Dogen's use of Zen language is not merely provisional or instrumental, but embodies a 'realisational' dimension. This is exemplified in the notion of the 'genjo-koan' or koan realised in the present, which is to say, actualised in every day activity. In this way, Kim endeavours to show that Dogen's Zen culminates in ' the great way of total exertion' (gujin no daido) or the total actualisation of practice as realization. Kim is a foremost interpreter of Dogen's thought - and, as such, this book deserves a place in every Buddhist library. My only reservation about this study, is that it might have made better sense of the question of how the so-called 'instrumentalist' aspect of koan practice relates tothe 'realizational' aspect. Quite rightly, Kim is at pains to point out that accounts of Zen which stress the 'instrumentalist' view of koan practice - and that alone, are one sided, and he has therefore endeavoured to illustrate a different perspective. However, without reflection, we might be left to conclude that Rinzai Zen favours the 'instrumentalist' view - and Soto, the 'realizational' view. Kim knows better, and indeed, in places (p. 165), he has cited certain remarks from Dogen, which concede that the term 'genjo-koan' originated with Engo - a Rinzai master of the Sung, evidently meaning that Rinzai practitioners have appreciated the 'realizational' aspect. As such, the critical references to (Dai-e) Ta-hui which appear elsewhere in the book, seem strangely out of tenor with this fact. Yuan-wu (Engo) was Ta-hui's teacher, and the latter must surely have known of his master's references to the genjo-koan. Conversely, much as we might identify Dogen's Zen with 'shikantaza' (just-sitting), playing down the instrumentalist approach, Dogen also had his experience of 'casting off mind and body' (shinjindatsuraku) - a breakthrough experience more or less akin to that realised by Rinzai followers. Perhaps Prof. Kim will enlighten us on this unresolved problem, at some future point.	2005-10-14

The leading characters are more charming and personable than usual - a middle-aged, tubercular purveyor of artificial flowers and a free-spirited, skilled infiltrator of the brave new (rather 19th-century) Brusel world who (rather remarkably) become lovers. Social points are made constantly, yet a light touch makes one receptive to them. Readers familiar with the English translations of Schuiten/Peeters and Schuiten/Schuiten will recognize the occasional translation and lettering gaffes, and ignore them - the humor has survived. I rank this with \\"The Tower\\" in terms of scope and characterization; \\"Urbicand\\" and \\"Samaris\\" are relatively monothematic and more graphic novellas than novels. When one sees the large numbers of volumes in this series yet to be translated, one can only hope that they, too, will find their way into English - I can't imagine ever knowing French well enough to appreciate these books.	2005-10-14

India does not sound welcoming at all.<br /><br />Mistry, India and readers everywhere would be better served by letting Maneck rescue his city friends at the end and bring them to the mountains.

Now republished in a new edition with a biographical preface about author Mary Eastman and featuring the quality painted landscapes of the original reproduced in color, Dahcotah Or, Life And Legends Of The Sioux retains its unique keen insight and attention to detail that distinguished it over one hundred and fifty years ago. Though Dahcotah is not an entirely unbiased account - for one thing, the author was a devout Christian who wished to see all Native Americans converted to her religion - yet it is written with empathy and sorrow for the sufferings of the Dahcotah people, retold in individual stories as well as broad descriptions, and deserves its reputation as a frontier classic.	2005-10-14

What country's health care system offers the best health services in the world, is constantly criticized for not being accessible enough, and yet is so accessible that overuse is leading to runaway costs? The first part of the riddle reveals that the answer could only be America. The remainder gives the contours of a paradox that vexes policymakers year in and year out. Welcome to health care, American-style.... To carry the health care debate on its next lap, America first needs a clear, well-informed, and well-reasoned analysis of the apparent paradox of its health care system. And it needs an agenda for reform that respects the wonders that modern medicine has developed and the creative market processes that deliver them. Cannon and Tanner offer proposals that would further tap the power of markets to make health care more valuable and more affordable. That makes Healthy Competition essential reading.\\"<br />--George P.

She has the biggest set of balls. I couldn't believe she was able to put herself out there so honestly and courageously. Besides the content of I'm No Saint, which is the story of every cool working, married woman I know, Hayt is a GREAT writer. She avoids cliches and tells a story that isn't pretty with a lot of humor. The book is so real, it first left me speechless and then sympathetic. I was not tantalized by the sex or drugs (been there, done that!), I was inspired by the Hayt's willingness to admit to her mistakes and turn herself around after making such a mess of her life, which included a coke addiction, bulimia, and bad taste in men. I loved the fact that, in the end, the only thing she cared more about than couture was her kid. It made her loveable and human. Her story is more than a sexual history. It's a journey of self-discovery that so many women will relate to.	2005-10-14

Although its title and photos depict Kate, this novel is not about her.  It's plot revolves around the tedious wanderings and musings of a depressed individual with low self esteem and body dimorphism.  As other reviewers have already commented, this is really two books.  The first is the whinings of the painfully depressed narrator, the second, interspersed randomly with the first, is an opinionated biography of Kate.  I suspect that the author is not actually a fan of Kate, and that he only used her name, history, and likeness to capitalize on an established base of fans who are hungry for anything new.  Shame on him.  My only hope is that Kate actually reads this drivel and sues him for associating her with such a piece of trash.  Don't waste your time and money.  If you truly want to know about Kate Bush, buy her albums and check out some of the web sites created by her fans.

The Baroque cycle is a study in intricate plots, characters that seem to number in the thousands, and difficult material that is not readily accessible to the average novel reader.  The Cryptonomicon met that description as well, but to a lesser degree.  While I enjoyed those books precisely for their complexity, many readers probably found them to be frustrating to read and difficult to follow. <br />  <br />The Stephen Bury novels do not present this problem for the casual reader.  They are stripped of most of the technical lingo, and they tend to follow more in the footsteps of modern thrillers.  The difference between these novels and the average Tom Clancy clone is that they revolve around powerful critiques of modern political cultures and bureacracies. <br /> <br />The Cobweb is the better of these two novels.  The central critique of the intelligence community is that competence without political acumen is tantamount to career suicide.  The book tracks the months between Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the start of Gulf War I and poses a terrifying question: what if the greatest enemies to our national security are the egomaniacs at the top of the security apparatus?  Given the events that have transpired in between the writing of this novel and today, the question raised by this novel seems prescient. <br /> <br />The one thing that is lacking from the Stephen Bury novels is the decadence of Stephenson's other works.  Stephenson is a novelist who has spent pages discussing the Captain Crunch-eating ritual of one of his characters (Cryptonomicon), the making of watered steel blades (the Baroque Cycle), and other incidental but vastly entertaining subjects too numerous to mention.  These passages exquisitely sideline the plots of his books for an exercise in pure intellectual indulgence.  Sadly, you will not find any such passages in this novel or in Interface.	2005-10-14

Bash was our first instinct, but that wouldn't be fair or useful. Let me explain... Total Body Makeover is another widely promoted health and fitness book my wife and I had on our list to read this summer (see all my reviews). The process we go through is to read it, try out a few of its ideas for a while, then read it again. On the first pass we both recoiled. The primary vehicle the author uses to communicate with his readers is to make emotional connections, not by providing actual information. (Much like the BFL for Women book). It relies heavily on third party client stories to get the page count up to sellable form. By the time you get to \\"Renee's Story\\" towards the end, you may either be asleep or tearing the pages out -- and that would be a shame, as the last 23 pages are quite useful. At the end of the book are 10 concise and informative comparative reviews of the most popular diet programs. You might be able to find the same info on the Internet for free but we've not come across one before so comprehensive and unbiased. Could be very helpful for someone weighing diet alternatives (honest... that was not an intended pun, it just slipped out :) <br /> <br />Not all readers are the same of course and some people may respond well to the book's Oprah-fluff. If you strip it out you're left with a rather serious proposition: Is your health and fitness situation dire enough, are you upset enough, are you serious about it enough, are you committed enough to spend 2 hours every day working out, plus spend the extra time it takes to plan, modify, and follow through on a new diet routine?  <br /> <br />The program esposed is a wolf in sheep's clothing and the book's title is apt. It really is \\"total body makeover\\" at its core. From our several week trials, very few people are going to be able to follow through with the program on their own for logistical and time management reasons. Those few that do will benefit. Preventing back-sliding after the 12 week \\"boot camp\\" is also a very real challenge. The author addresses this topic, but in our experience all the get-fit-quick programs suffer high rates of back-sliding. That this program's pedegree is celebrity-trainer based is obvious to us.  <br /> <br />So where does the book end up in our stack? It's more useful than BFL for Women. Not as helpful to the masses as the original BFL. The only book that stands out from the crowd so far is Avery Hunicutt's Joe X. (We practice the Joe X routine now and so impressed with the book we're going to go back and re-review it at some point. We didn't give it near enough credit the first time around. But next up: we'll be reviewing Harley Pasternak's 5-Factor Fitness, another of the heavily promoted books.)	2005-10-14

This is a part of the Battletech series about the Rebublic of the Sphere.  I liked these names of places: Sirius, Terra Firma, Elgin, Halstead Station (Chicago connection), New Rhodes III, Schedar (instead of Scholar), Woodstock, and Fletcher (Jonathan's friend).  There are nine prefectures, the tenth is Reblic Territory in the middle of the Inner Sphere.  The names he used were familiar Anglican names like Thomas, Ray, Max, Blake, Victor, Kim, Andrea, with a few strange ones tossed in liek Bianca, Ring, and Gypsy.  Pep was a nickname for being small and quick.  Count Hector is the master.  In Santa Fe, North America, there is a Terra Prefecture X, called the Republic of the Sphere.    War is a silly little game where nobody wins.  Huxley commends: \\"Logical consequences are the scarecrows of fools and the beacons of wise men.\\"  Wise men think twice before they act once.

Daniel Boorstin feels that \\"the greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.\\"  Napolean who lost the Battle at Waterloo, stated: \\"A battle sometimes decides everything; and sometimes the merest trifle decides a battle\\" and \\"In war, as in love, we must come into contact before we can triumph.\\"    Accius is quoted as saying :Oderint, dum metuant.  Let them hate, so long as they fear.\\"   He waxes poetic with Shelley, \\"To that high Capital, where kingly Death keeps his pale court in beauty and decay, He came.\\"  Shakespeare qualifies for three quotes, \\"As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport,\\" \\"\\"It is to be all made of faith and service...it is to be all made of fantasy,\\" and \\"I am as true as truth's simplicity, and simpler than the infancy of truth.\\"    This is in the form of a narrative by Mason Dunne.  \\"I was in combat, no doubt about it, but I was detached from it.  I knew then that I had to be a Ghost Knight.  I saw another vision.\\"  The fish sees the bait, but not the hook.  George Bernard Shaw wrote \\"He who bears the brand of Cain shall rule the earth.\\"  There are references from the Bible, even one by Jeremiah (prophet of doom).  Sam Donelly tells how he procured a hovercab, Mad Cat III, from a rental agency -- a Cabochon, the most popular model because of its safety construction.  \\"The display was breathtaking and, I'll admit, I'd just started to drift unconsciously past,\\" in vino veritas, was told, 'You don't look like a ghost to me.  \\"No, my friend, I don't, which is exactly why I am one.\\"    Others in this series of Dark Age, LETHAL HERITAGE, BLOOD LEGACY, and LOST DESTINY, are from the Blood of Kerensky.

In terms of programming concepts and OOP design for financial engineering, this book has no equals. We have Daniel Duffy's Financial Instrument Pricing Using C++, but it takes a different approach (i.e. generic programming based in STL). All through the book, the author introduces improvements sequentially and doesn't start from the best design from the outset in order to demonstrate the flaws of a less general/useful/reusable program. In this sense, this is mainly a conceptual book, not an example book. For example, it deals with and develops vanilla-option pricing using Monte Carlo simulation over the first five chapters. A reader looking for a cookbook that gives programs to implement a large number of financial-derivative models would be well-advised to look elsewhere (e.g. Justin London's Modeling Derivatives in C++).

Kerley's plot is tightly wrapped even when straying into apparent unrelated tangential incidents.  He concludes his novel with a surprise twist when he reveals the perpetrator of the crimes he chronicles.<br /><br />Ryder and Nautilus, members of the psycho and sociopathological investigative team are summoned to a murder scene in a seedy motel where a woman has been killed and adorned with candles that have melted on her body.  The room was festooned with bouquets of flowers.  Soon thereafter Ryder receives an anonymous phone call inquiring whether any art had been found at the scene.<br /><br />The anonymous caller was retired Alabama detective Jacob Willow who sensed that the crime was reminiscent of the killings committed by psychopathic mass murderer Marsden Hexcamp some 30 years ago.  Hexcamp, an accomplished artist who studied in Paris, led a Manson-like entourage of wayward souls.  Hexcamp's group which consisted mainly of women was controlled by his paramour the alluring and manipulative vamp known as Calypso. The group migrated from Paris to Alabama.  Under their guidance the group committed six brutal murders as if they were an art project.  Marsden at his trial had been shot and killed by Calypso who then turned the gun on herself.<br /><br />As the investigation went forward Ryder and Nautilus got drawn into the world of art collection consisting of works by notorious and infamous criminals.  Soon other murders were committed and haunting and alluring pieces of artwork purported to be created by Hexcamp appeared at the crime scenes.<br /><br />Not only did a serial murderer with ties to the long gone Hexcamp have to be apprehended but an apparent clandestine sale of Hexcamp's artwork seemingly was to be conducted.<br /><br />The detectives using a wide array of supporting players such as TV investigative reporter Dee Dee Danbury and Ryder's own brother Jeremy, himself a serial murderer confined to an institution for the criminally insane, try to make sense out of the bizarre clues and solve the crimes.players such as TV investigative reporter Dee Dee Danbury and Ryder's own brother Jeremy, himself a serial murderer confined to an institution for the criminally insane, try to make sense out of the bizarre clues and solve the crimes.	2005-10-14

It's a story of his two-month stay in Pyongyang while overseeing the production of a popular French children's cartoon. Delisle is not lost on the sad irony of his position, and tells his story simply and without pretense.<br /><br />The book deals mainly with how frustrating life is in the capital, even for a privileged foreigner like him: bad food, constant surveillance, blaring propanda songs, etc.<br /><br />It's probably most affecting when you get a real sense of the inner lives of his guide and translator. Both are very buttoned-up, proper and repressed. At one point Delisle lends one of them his copy of \\"1984\\"; when the guy returns it a week later he seems very nervous and mutters something about how he \\"doesn't like science fiction.\\" On the other hand, he rejoices when he gets a bottle of Hennessy as a going-away present.<br /><br />In the most terrifying episode Delisle asks his guide where all the handicapped people are in Pyongyang, and the guide responds that there aren't any handicapped people in North Korea.

A buddy of Neil's from his hometown of Livingston, Dr. Albert Rice, drops in for a visit.  This happens just as a family from their hometown also drops in for a visit.  Mr. & Mrs. Cady come with their son Homer and their daughter Gladys.  Mr. Cady is a wealthy but grumpy entrepreneur.  Homer is also a businessman who seems tied to the phone making business calls while Gladys is a debutante socialite concerned with the color of her dresses.  Gladys for some unknown reason has a crush on Neil and pursues him.  His buddy Albert who sees Neil wasting his time giving lessons rather than writing encourages him to marry Gladys as a way to help him out of his money woes.  Although Neil has an eye for Cynthia across the hall, she also sees how he'd be more able to write his music if he marries into the wealthy family.  After the Cady's leave, Cynthia rejects Neil for his own good, although she deeply cares for him.  This causes Neil to pick up the phone and propose to Gladys who gushes that she can now start telling all her friends and planning engagement parties.  Dr. Albert, seeing that Neil is near exhaustion, orders him to bed.  Neil falls asleep thus starting the main part of the play, which is an extended expressionistic dream sequence.<br /><br />In the dream, locations fade from one to another where Mr. Cady makes Neil join the family business.  Everytime Neil wants to work on writing music, there is always another party to which Gladys drags him.  Frustrated and increasingly unhappy, Neil is finally put in an art manufacturing company where songwriters turn out nice jazz tunes that will sell a million and a half.  Ideas come from the inspiration department and are forwarded to the composer who dashes off the tune.  Writers turn out books that copy much of the plot from their previous book to meet publishing deadlines that results in books being distributed 45 minutes after they are written.  Neil's agony increases to the point where he picks up a paper knife and kills Mr. & Mrs. Cady, his wife Gladys and his brother-in-law Homer.  This starts an epic trial where tickets for jurors are sold like movie theatre tickets and the jurors are dancing instructors who dance with Gladys.  The judge is none other than the dead Mr. Cady and the deceased Mrs. Cady comes back as a witness.  Albert becomes the prosecuting attorney and objections are made to Neil's looks.  The jury does not care for Neil's looks and convicts him.  This ends the dream.<br /><br />Gladys shows up to inquire if they could postpone their engagement because she's run into one of her old boyfriends who wants to show her the city; and of course, he wouldn't be comfortable doing so if she's engaged.  Neil and Gladys decide they are not meant for each other which allows Neil to set his sights back on Cynthia who has now returned and is willing to settle for a life that is less successful but is filled with love.<br /><br />It is an interesting play, one that would require a legion of stagehands and set designers to produce effectively.  It is an indictment of business vs. art, something with which both Kaufman & Connelly seem extremely knowledgeable.  I couldn't quite figure out what the title had to do with the play, but I did appreciate reading this great example ofAmerican expressionism.  Enjoy!xample of American expressionism.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

I had to have it when I first saw it in Border's bookstore. I ran out to Michael's Craft store that night and loaded up on Wilton \\"candy melts\\".  The decorated cakes in this book are fabulous.  They are not your ordinary buttercream rose cakes that are a single uniform color.  They are not formal fondant covered structures. They are...well..whimsical - that is the perfect word for these cakes.  They are bright and fun and bold and artistic, delicious and just plain amazing.  But I must admit, the melted chocolate decorations are not as easy as they appear in the book's instructions.  I'm not at all a beginner baker but this is the first time I've made \\"art\\" with melted chocolate and mine did not look so good. I've only tried it twice though and I am going to keep trying. Hopefully I will improve. The chocolate designs in this book are the dream results I strive for.  I've sat and read this book cover to cover about 4 times now.  I'm obsessed! The tiered cakes that she designs can have 2 or 3 completely different patterns or colors in the same cake. Sometimes each tier has a different pattern and color on each side. The colors are deep and are not commonly seen on cakes but on her cakes they look appropriate. Usually a cake decorating book concentrates on just the actual decorating part and the recipes are not that important to the author.  Not with this book. These recipes are excellent and easy.  Pretty basic flavors and instructions and very very good. I can't wait for the Christmas season when I can attempt to make that cute light blue snowman cake. The decorated cakes shown in this book would be fun to design but they just put ideas in your head for your own creations and you can just go wild with the possibilities!  I highly recommend this book!	2005-10-14

As a physician and early American history buff I was really looking forward to learning more about Benjamin Rush.<br /><br />In general it seems that the author, despite putting out what appears to be a finished, presentable biography, never really dug into source materials to find out who Benjamin Rush was and why he was important.  Repeatedly, we hear of Rush's fame and accomplishments and influence, but the details are missing.<br /><br />We hear what a great doctor Rush was, considered the preeminent physician of his times, according to the author, but all the author writes about is how Rush tortured his patients with medical treatments we now know are harmful, such as bloodletting, giving cathartics, etc.  Rush is known as the \\"Father of American Psychiatry\\", his book on psychiatry was bible for many many years, and his observations on mental illness were in many ways way way ahead of his times...yet not a word of this is mentioned except in the last ten pages of this 365 page book.  This subject desperately needed to explained.  This is why he is important for heaven's sake.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think it would have been fascinating to have gotten a better feel for what bloodletting and giving cathartics was about, we needed some good old source material, firsthand observations and then-current thoughts, as well as an expose of the tools employed, etc.  Rush, it is clear, considered himself first and foremost and physician.  He dedicated his life to the practice of medicine, he was considered a top academic lecturer.  We are told all the top American physicians for the next half century were either disciples of Rush or disciples of his students.....but we don't really get a feeling for why.<br /><br />His political contributions and inolvement were similarly neglected.  Although he wasn't the political calibre of Hamilton or Jefferson, he was definitely a major player.  Much of the earlier portion of the biography seemed to focus on explaining the political events occurring around Rush during the fight for independence.  The focus should have been Rush.  There's a lot of negativity surrounding Rush early on in the book, but how he seems to know all the important figures in the Revolution and why they respect him is not explained.<br /><br />There also weren't any pictures or illustrations.  I could go on.  On the bright side, at least the book reads well.  If you want to learn more about Rush, you should probably choose another book.  Sorry.	2005-10-14

Navajo peacemaking has earned renown as a \\"horizontal system of justice\\", in which all participants are treated as equals with the foremost mission of preserving ongoing relationships and restoring harmony. There is no coercion, no \\"sides\\", no labels of plaintiff or defendant. Essays discuss the history of Navajo peacemaking, its concepts and practices, assessments of the model, and conclusions as to what can be learned from this system of justice.

Details, details, details. That's really what successful event planning is all about, and that's the key to this very successful event-planning manual. Author Judy Allen notes, lists, copes with and gives an example of virtually every detail in planning anything from a sedate corporate event in a major city to a huge celebration on a remote island. She provides examples galore plus tips, questions and answers, sample cost sheets and schedules. How much floor space does a person need to be comfortable in a tent? Answer: 20 square feet. How many bathrooms should be available for a party? Answer: One per 75 guests. And don't forget to ask about the stemware, adequate parking and even the photographer's back-up camera battery. This author seems to have thought every contingency, as the book's ambitious title promises. Her one glaring omission is that she does not include the party planner's fee - our guess is that she'd be worth it. We highly recommend this well-organized, very practical book to all event planners. Don't send out press releases for your party without consulting Judy Allen.	2005-10-14

He lacks the refinement that McClean and Clancy achieved, but not the excitement or the believability.  With the added attraction of Bible based futurism, this book is not only very readable, but also a bellwether of modern reality fiction.  You may disagree with the fundamental premise of this book, but you will not regret reading it.   <br />* This is a bold book, launching into verboten format, subject matter, and choice of protagonists.  Four pages of introduction by the publisher before the title page, plotted on an Old Testament prophecy, and introducing Messianic Jews into the Israeli government, the author and the publisher risked accusations of right wing extremism and political incorrectness ... and have silenced their critics. <br />* World War III is coming, and the end result is almost certain devastation.  Not only has the old soviet Russia risen from the cloak of its own ashes, but it has emasculated its prime enemies by brilliant and cunning propaganda and usage of subterfuge, misdirection, and infiltration.  The U.S. president is backed into a corner with his hands tied, most of America's allies have been blackmailed into throwing aside their cloaks of friendship and forgetting the lessons of World War II.  The Jews are abandoned to a new holocaust, and Israel faces its darkest days since Nebuchadnezzar's forces carried Jerusalem away to Babylon.   <br />* But the Senior Advisor to the President, Jon Bennett, is busy on a peace mission to Moscow.  Accompanied by his long time associate and perennial date, Erin McCoy, he is unprepared for the literal firestorm which sweeps him into the picture.  If there is to be a peaceful solution to this dilemma, he is the world's last chance.  But HE FAILS. <br />* What follows is a race against time and evil.  A believable love story is the motivation for Bennett's personal involvement while his professional involvement is motivated by the very existence of life and freedom.  There seems to be no solution for either problem.  With a sensitive but uncensored presentation of his turmoil, the reader is drawn into his fight by a gripping adventure that makes U.S. President MacPherson, Israeli Prime Minister Doron, former head of Mossad Dr. Mordechai, and the new Russian Czar to be the supporting cast in a drama of the world gone berserk. <br />* This book is also to be commended for what it doesn't have, filthy language, bedroom scenes, and glorification of that which is evil.  It proves that a book can be sold, even if it doesn't cater to the prurient interests of a degenerate audience. <br />* That said, there are legitimate criticisms of this book.  First, by chosing a modern translation of the Bible, the author has lost much of the authority of the prophecy that would have been present had he chosen to quote the time honored King James Bible.  Second, while otherwise remaining faithful to Biblical teaching, he strays into angelic appearances to preach the Gospel, and third, most pre-millennial prophetic scholars would agree that Mr. Rosenberg has misplaced the timing of his prophecy.  A fourth point is the most dissappointing ommission of the role of the Roman Catholic Church.  Where the Bible points the finger of God's wrath at the city that sits on seven hills, the author redirects this attention to an as yet unbuilt Iraqi Babylon.  Nevertheless, the impact of the fulfilment of Biblical prophecy can not be overestimated. <br />	2005-10-14

In this true life story, which represents yet another publishing coup by Vermont independent Chelsea Green Press ([...]), Diane Wilson - working class shrimp boat captain and mother of five - recounts the often-harrowing account of her five year fight to hold corporate polluter Formosa Plastics to a \\"zero emissions\\" policy for their insidious (but all too typical) waste disposal methods in Wilson's town of Sea Drift, Texas.    And get this.    Wilson won.    How she defeated the machinations of one of the world' largest and most powerful industrial polluters is the subject of the book, which also offers honest insights into life in a southern seaside working class community from a woman's point of view, a community that I never knew existed (though the EPA ranks it as one of the most polluted counties in the country).     And who out there knows women can captain shrimp boats? Or understands that women actually can play characters other than vamps or victims? I've read books populated with women all my life, but until this real life story, I've never met a woman like Diane Wilson. In a literary world dripping with testosterone, car chases, and gun play, Wilson is no shrinking violet, no damsel in distress.     Exactly the opposite. She intuits her way through what becomes one of the most courageous struggles for justice  I've read in a long while, challenging corporate control over our economic and political life with grit, good humor, and vernacular insights that, while uneven in some places, made me laugh and cry and cheer and buy copies of this book for friends and family.    She also, in the most wry and self-deprecating way imaginable, made most of the men in her life look like pantywaists by comparison.     Books like an \\"Unreasonable Woman\\" come along only rarely. Diane Wilson is a working class heroine with heart, an activist with the guts to do somethingabout the problems confronting her. The world is a better place for having her and her story in it.     If you are not inspired after reading this book, it might be time to forgo reading altogether.	2005-10-14

In his defense, however, I will say that this novella is interesting, for a work that grew out of a play performed by the author and Charles Dickins. It's a typical Victorian melodrama, with coincidences abounding everywhere, and florid speeches and unusual (for our time) actions by the main characters. There really isn't any character development, perhaps because the tale is so short, but you do get into the spirit of the story fairly quickly.

I recommend her on my lists because I think there's room for all kinds of books in the genre, and I'm so happy there's more historical fiction being published these days. <br /> <br />That said, \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" veers more toward romantic fiction than historical. It is a tepid approach to the tumultous and ultimately deadly triangle between Elizabeth I, Robert Dudley and Amy Robsart, with Elizabeth in particular depicted as an insecure, vacilliating, and fearful partner to Robert Dudley's overpowering virility and ambition. The strategy of telling part of the story through Amy's eyes offered a lot of promise, but her dependance on Robert and refusal to face the facts of her marriage - even after he has left her alone in the country for most of the book! - starts to look pathetic and not in a way that rouses much sympathy from the reader. <br /> <br />However, the portrayal of Robert himself is compelling; it reminded me in a way of C.W. Gortner's depiction of a much younger yet equally arrogant Robert in \\"The Secret Lion\\" and it is here where Philippa Gregory scores points. She has captured the pride and seething need to prove himself that drives Robert. An interesting addition to the canon but not one of my favorites.	2005-10-14

Everyone should read this, especially if you're one of the few to notice what Levy has pointed out. I've been talking about some of these issues mentioned for a few years now. Or whenever Britney Spears,  Christina Aguliera, Jessica Simpson, and Sex and the City burst onto the pop culture radar. <br /> <br />Levy's writing style is easy to read, not at all distracting like some other writers in this genre, like Naomi Wolf, who take the focus off the material. I really apreciate the chapter devoted to the women's movement since I was born years after and the women's studies class i recently took failed to cover it. That chapter puts some things in perspective for me. Read this book. You will not be disappointed.	2005-10-14

For anyone who loves horses, mules, romance, camping and the Mountain West, High Country has been well worth the wait. In this action packed story, Wyman masterfully tells of Ty Hardin, son of a Bitteroot Valley rancher, who leaves the farm during the Depression for a packer's life in Montana's Swan Range. Ty learns the ropes from a Fenton Pardee, a veteran guide, who also becomes his mentor and close friend. Tending to dudes and hunters, crossing snowbound passes, fording swollen rivers, encounters with bogs and bears, mule wrecks of epic proportions - and coming of age in town -  High Country captures the fears, dreams and fantasies of all who live for life on the trail. <br /> <br />This book is a tale of riveting adventure, romantic love, profound sadness and natural beauty which is hard to put down. I honestly didn't want it to end. On one hand it is unique simply because it focuses on the packing industry and its culture - topics which, as literature, haven't been seen much on the printed page.  <br /> <br />On the other, more than just a first in its genre (does another packer's adventure novel even exist?), High Country is also a profound description of the people and landscapes all of us as westerners love - high country landscapes, before coffee table books, when wilderness was something to be experienced fist hand.  <br /> <br />High Country is a book you'll want to throw in your saddlebags  and talk about around the campfire. Like your favorite camping trip, warm memories of High Country will last long into the night. If you like the Mountain West, this is a great read in every way. I promise you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

Hubbard rose to the challenge of giving the old theme a brand new twist by having the characters despise one another at first sight. Cady's emotions are skewed though by the circumstances under which she meets Keren, those of her grandmother dying from illness. Torn between her love for her grandmother and her love for Keren, Cady weakens under the weight of such emotion. Of all people, it is Keren who bolsters her in her time of need and by sharing her pain, he learns how to express the love that's been bottled inside him for so long. Keren is a fascinating foil for Cady. He is somber and emotionless where Cady is colorful and speaks her mind. It's a brilliant pairing of opposites and I was delighted by the growth of their relationships. The sex scenes are filled with passion and detail, yet Hubbard achieves a fine balance. There are still some things left for just Cady and Keren, which made the story even more real. This novel is joyous and deserves to be read by true fans of romance.	2005-10-14

It's not proprietary. And it's not a proper noun -- it's an acronym (although it's usually spelled as if it were a proper noun).  Instead, Ajax is a collection of techniques for building highly interactive Web based applications using industrial-strength JavaScript and asynchronous communications, and it's taking the Web development world by storm. This is one of the first books to appear on this very hot topic, and I have to say it's a very good one. <br /> <br />\\"Foundations of Ajax\\" takes you through the whys and wherefores of Ajax, as well as the meat and potatoes, at a brisk pace. The examples are crystal clear. One difficulty in describing Ajax applications is that they're inherently multi-language -- part is always JavaScript, and the rest is always written in a server-side language of your choice. Choosing a particular server language might have alienated some readers unfamiliar with it. This book neatly sidesteps the problem by using fixed XML files for the server component for most examples, which leads to startlingly simple descriptions. <br /> <br />As someone who has already learned the basics of Ajax, however, I found the second half of the book even more valuable. The last few chapters talk about tools and techniques for building real-life professional-grade applications. There is excellent, detailed information about documenting, unit testing and debugging for JavaScript, debugging Ajax communications, and using some of the newfangled Ajax frameworks that have begun to appear. These chapters credibly demonstrate that it's possible to treat JavaScript as a Serious Programming Language. <br /> <br />In sum, I think that \\"Foundations of Ajax\\" is an excellent piece of work which belongs on every Web developer's bookshelf.	2005-10-14

For an introduction: I haven't read any of Dan Simmons' other works, so I can't compare them.  I was recommended to read this book by a mention online. <br /> <br />At present, I am 160 pages in, of a 368-page hardcover edition.  I feel I've given this book a chance.  And I'm not going to continue it. <br /> <br />The \\"accidents\\" the protagonist reconstructs are nothing more than urban legends endlessly recycled on the internet, and disproved via Mythbusters and Snopes.com.  Lots of the \\"humor\\" parts of the book are also recycled - I remember seeing these jokes (and I use the term loosely) in the mid-1990s when I first started using email, and in prior years via fax at my workplace.  Probably they've been around much, much longer.  To read about the protagonist and his friend laughing hysterically over stuff that, by all rights, had probably been forwarded to their faxes or inboxes years earlier - well, it didn't make for good reading. <br /> <br />Overall, the recycled nature of the stories and humor made me wish I'd been paid to forward said stories and humor on to the world. <br /> <br />Secondly, the protagonist is an Uberman.  He's fantastically wealthy (how?), a crack shot, apparently possessed of Holmesian genius when it comes to sniffing out clues and deducing what happened, a super-genius who graduated college at 19, and the list goes on.  Plus he's jaded with the world, of course.  I had no way of empathizing with this character who has everything and then mopes - it reminds me too much of the \\"emo kids\\" on the internet today who whine about how hard their poor-little-rich-kid life is. <br /> <br />Third, the product placement in this book is astonishing.  The descriptions of how wonderful the protagonists' Acura is just defied belief.  This sort of behavior stuck out in Crichton's Jurassic Park, too (that book is mentioned in Darwin's Blade).  I began skipping over the many, and lengthy, product descriptions as the book went on. <br /> <br />Fourth, the author uses his space to get technical, as though I'm back in college at a physics lecture.  The demands of a fellow investigator to keep giving details are the excuse for Simmons to expound at length on this.  At least when other authors (such as Scalzi in Old Man's War) use a character as a mouthpiece to explain science to the masses, they try to simplify it for said masses. <br /> <br />I'm glad I got this book out of the library and didn't pay money for it.  As it is, I won't be finishing it - besides the above problems, it took forever for any clues as to the bad guys' motives or identities to come up, and then it felt strained when they did come up. <br /> <br />There's better books out there.  Skip this one if you've had your fill of urban legends and/or old internet pass-along jokes.	2005-10-14

T, the main character, is out taking a road trip in upstate NY, when he comes across two young hitchikers. It's a risky move to take them on, but T does just that. What happens next is a study of trust between these two hitchikers and their driver. Falco explores the question of how well you can know somebody you've just met and, in using flashbacks into the history of T's life, Falco simultaneously explores the question of how well you can know somebody that you've been with for a long time (in this case, T's ex-wives, lovers, etc.). With his interaction with his two passangers and through flashbacks, T disects his failed marriages, his previous love affairs, his childhood, and his capacity for abuse. In a thriller that never lets you stop turning pages, T reconciles questions about his abusive childhood and why he downloaded a picture of child ponography that, in his mind, started the whole crazy and dangerous adventure with the hitchikers.<br /><br />This is a serious book that examines some serious questions about what it means to live a good, happy, life, free from abusive relationships.<br /><br />Ed Falco's short stories contain many scenes inside cars and many of Falco's protagonists are young seductive females. WOLF POINT does not disappoint in this respect: In addition to much of the early parts of WOLF POINT taking place inside of a car, the 57 year-old protagonist, T, finds himself seductively tortured by a very attractive young lady in her early 20s. This seduction is not just added to the book to make it fun to read, it is included because through these scenes, T unravels the answers to the questions of his life.<br /><br />In the end, both T and the reader learn lessons about what it means to be honest and what it means to give and take abuse. Good literature teaches lessons.<br /><br />Enjoy some good literature; read WOLF POINT today.ad WOLF POINT today.	2005-10-14

For example the images of the God and Goddess cards include subtle symbolism that connects them with any cultural expression (Celtic, Germanic, Roman, Greek, etc).  The God card features Harvest Lord symbolism, waning & waxing year symbolism, woodland symbolism, warrior symbolism, and solar symbolism.  The Goddess card features celestrial symbolism, nature symbolism, and Underworld symbolism.  This type of depth makes the deck ideal for any tradition of Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca. <br /> <br />In addition to the general widespread Pagan connection and appeal, the deck also includes cards that are typically associated specifically with Witchcraft and Wicca.  However, in reality this is not entirely exclusive, as the companion book presents general themes of Paganism that are also associated with the cards.  Here again the deck shines in its universal application. <br /> <br />An exciting aspect of this deck is its unique use as a system of divination, a teaching tool, a ritual kit, and a source for guided imagery journeys.  This makes the deck ideal for solitary practitioners, and people who require privacy when practicing.  I read on a forum that military people are finding it useful to perform full moon rituals at sea or on base without drawing attention.  Another person noted that the deck would be ideal for prisoners, as the cards provide them with ritual tools that they cannot otherwise possess. <br /> <br />If you want a deck that speaks to you, and goes beyond the standard stuff we've all seen over and over again, then this is the deck for you. <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

First-rate historian and author Niall Ferguson offers a politically incorrect interpretation of the four-century history of the British Empire. Sure, he acknowledges that the imperialists stole, murdered and enslaved on their way to world domination. Yet, Ferguson argues, the Brits spread several traditions, including liberty, democracy and free trade, which improved the state of the world. To Ferguson's credit, he makes no attempt to gloss over the Empire's atrocities. In fact, with stellar prose, he takes the risk of undermining his central theme by describing the Empire's bad behavior in great detail. His conclusions are as complex as history itself, which might prove frustrating to readers seeking simple answers. We strongly recommend this memoir to readers who love history, and particularly to those seeking a historical perspective on the pitfalls of imperialism.	2005-10-14

It seems the whole area is infested with the spiders who take the heads of humans, except for a temple which is inhabited by Nazuna and a wizened priest. But when the spiders break into the temple, Inuyasha is at a loss because it just happens to be the time in all half-demons lives when they lose their demonic power and become fully human for a short time! Our heroes will have to use their brains instead of brawn this time. After that they will have to deal with a witch that steals Kikyo's bones in an effort to resurrect the priestess that imprisoned Inuyasha for 50 years!  <br /> <br />What can I say about any work by Rumiko Takahasi? They are probably the best manga out there! She is a genius! The great thing about this volume is that we learn a bit more about the past conflict between Inuyasha and Kikyo and that their relationship was a bit more \\"involved\\" than we were led to believe. It wasn't just a simple battle for the possession of the Shikon Jewel. The twist of making Inuyasha become a human for a night was also a clever twist in the plot.

But this book comes awfully close. Panelists of The Blood-Horse were polled to see which Derby was the most memorable. Of course, it is true with what D. Wayne Lukas said in the forward, \\"They're all special.\\" But the panelists picked their top ten: Secretariat, and who wouldn't pick him? He was a superhorse that finished the derby in under two minutes! What a freak! Canonero the second, now this was a story I did not know of, but this one about the venuezuelan horse that won the derby and preakness at impeccible odds deserves a novel of it's own. Iron Leige's derby triumph was pretty ironic, what with the fact that Shoemaker, on Gallant Man, was warned not to stand up in his stirrups during the race and that is exactly what happened! Affirmed and Alydar, of course, carry a rivalry that goes unmatched. Citation, the Calumet iron horse, was a magnificent freak of nature, always fun to read that story. Brokers Tip, Black Gold and Regret, stories of derbies long in the past, were fascinating for their way of bringing history back to you in such a vivid way. Alysheba's incredible journey around the turn was enough to start off a remarkable career. and last but not least, Calumet's other triple crown star, Whirlaway. All of them bring back the days of wine and roses, on one of the most historic days that has been celebrated over 100 years.

Over 2,000 + years of boring old tradition, square churches, and legalism can now be corrected by Donald Miller.  This guy moves from Texas to Oregon and realizes he needs a bigger suitcase to move Christianity with him: Extreme faith makeover, Christianity addition. I discerned two points from this book: (1) smoking and drinking are not sins and (2) Christians don't all think like fundamentalists. These revelations hardly require you to invest your time and money in blue like jazz. Take Calvin, take Hayek, take hope.	2005-10-14

As a Bible-believing evangelical Christian, I believe it to be extremely valuable to study and explore other faiths.  After being challenged by a Mormon friend to further explore their doctrine, I purchased this book.  Ironically, even though the Mormon church states that the BOOK OF MORMON contains the \\"fullness of the everlasting gospel\\", you'll find many contradictions to the Book of Mormon and Biblical theology in \\"Mormon Doctrine\\" and other 'sacred' Mormon writings and teachings.  <br />I believe that God was always God and that Christ is His ONLY begotten son, that He is not married, does not have a body of flesh and bones and as He is now He has forever been and always will be.  This book helped me to see that the complexities involved in the Mormon religion are simply beyond reason, and I am thankful that this resource is available to show Mormons where the contradictions within their religion lie.  I also found it interesting to note the different definitions that Mormons use for the same \\"jargon\\" we use in the Christian world.  Most notable was \\"atonement\\" ... interesting. <br />God bless any Christian who reads this book in order to more effectively discuss what matters most with their Mormon friends.  May we all always \\"speak the truth in love.\\"  Jesus loves you and He died for you ...	2005-10-14

The book is a good starting point for you (and loved ones) if you're unfamiliar with living an organic/natural/active/non-toxic lifestyle. It can be the start of a healthy journey for the rest of your and your family's life - and even SAVE your lives. You'll get starting advice on designing and living a life that minimizes (and likely prevents) the onset of most illnesses that seemingly require only pharmaceuticals - pill popping is NOT the only solution. Isn't that the cure of all cures - prevention and healthy maintenance? Of course, there's a place for wonderful antidotes and medical breakthroughs like penicillin, but not ALL pharmaceuticals like Vioxx are as safe as they may sound. Those are just \\"bandages\\" that don't address the source, which can include the foods you eat, the quality of the environment you surround yourself with, your physical activity, etc. <br /> <br />Even if you already have an illness, some simple lifestyle changes may be all it takes to reverse the condition. He mentions a lot of tips, some you've heard, some you haven't. One is eating the organic equivalents of the current foods you eat. Yes, organic food is a little more expensive, but how expensive is a trip to the hospital, or a visit to the doctor or lost wages due to being sick and not able to go to work. When you do the math, organic food isn't that expensive and well-worth buying. You may look into reading a book called, \\"The Taste That Kills\\". And think of regular cow's milk: it's been pumped with hormones and have grazed in pastures treated with artificial herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. I now drink organic milk (and may switch to soy or almond milk). And artificial sugars.. my co-worker and her husband have stopped drinking diet soda and her migraines and his lethargy are gone. <br /> <br />After making some changes, I've stopped taking Aciphex! If you don't know, it's a drug for acid reflux. It's meant to be taken once daily, ideally for the rest of your life! I have taken it for 3 years DAILY. The independence is PRICELESS. <br /> <br />I have much more energy, more vibrancy and vitality, my skin is youthful since making the simple changes mentioned in the book and from my own research on the net and in books. I don't do everything he suggests - I just took what's useful. It wasn't easy as some things had an \\"addictive\\" pull that I had to persist through - but it's worth it. Plus, I was annoyed at first because this isn't exactly cheap to do. I made some sacrifices; I managed my spending better. This small cost of treating your body/mind like gold outweighs the cost of getting sick and feeling much less than ecstatic. <br /> <br />In addition, you'll get his interesting viewpoint of the motivations of the pharma's, FDA et al. I believe that justifies checking this book out... to form your own opinion, dissenting or otherwise. What if... he's not making any of this up? He does sound a bit fanatical about it but it has prompted me to be aware of the possibility of the FDA, politicians, and pharmaceuticals silently helping each other, for example: \\"On February 10, 1993, Sen. Chafee and his wife purchased between 2,000 and 30,000 dollars worth of stock in Merck (the giant pharmaceutical... specializing in human AND animal drugs). It just so happens that this purchase coincides with the introduction of at least five major health-care bills. And since Sen. Chafee sits on the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health as well as the Subcommittee on Medicare, his purchase of Merck constitutes an immediate and glaring conflict of interest (motherjones).\\" <br /> <br />I think the main value of this book is that it will help people to wake up and take charge of their health - that's a good thing! Research the things he mentions that resonate with you. Add some regular exercise and healthy foods AND eliminate fast food, all soda, refined sugars, TV/microwave dinners, 10-minute oven pizzas, artificially sweetened ANYTHING, hormone milk, potatochips, cheap bread, anything fried. If you can honestly say your life won't be better doing that, then take those prescribed drugs to alleviate the conditions that are caused by those foods. That's like purposely cutting yourself and putting a band-aid on. You have more control over your health than you realize. Again, compare the cost of changing some of your habits to how expensive a trip to the hospital is, or a visit to the doctor or lost wages due to being sick and not able to go to work. <br /> <br />It's not a perfect how-to book, but it's a start, and a start is all you need. What's nice about this book is that you get both a beginner's guide to conscious health and a controversial report about the FDA, pharmaceuticals, et al. The latter has had a big influence on me, to the point where I'm going to volunteer some time to 1) educating instead of EXCLUSIVELY medicating 2) help (somehow and however small) to check and balance the powers-that-be involved with the big pharmaceuticals. <br /> <br />If you get this book (or similar), may it start you on a healthier and happier, stress-free life.	2005-10-14
US	31115146	R3SUW4H9ZHKIG9	0821770624	963914305	Five Golden Rings	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Only one story was really worth it - and that was a reissue!	Boy was I glad that I found this book at a thrift store for $1, otherwise I would have been very dissapointed. <br /> <br />1st story: Fern Michaels - A Bright Red Ribbon: Alone in her car, a weary traveler becomes lost in a blizzard. But a dog wearing a scarlet ribbon will lead Morgan Ames to a safe haven...and into the arms of a most unlikely hero. <br /> <br />How did Fern Michaels get to be so famous? Sorry to all the fans of hers out there, but I think her writing stinks! This book reads like something I would have written when I was 14. I never even got more than ten pages into before I skipped to next story. I mean, a woman barges into a man's house, through a doggie door of all things, and he goes into a twenty line speech, (saying \\"Sorry I wasn't here to welcome you\\" - what? He's never even seen her before!) and at the end, he's already telling her that he has a warm robe in the spare bedroom where she can stay. Huh? Completely unrealistic. He's never even seen her before, and he's already going into details like the fact that he's got a robe for her. I mean, where's the, \\"Oh my gosh, as you all right? Where did you come from?\\" Nope, he just starts talking her head off. I read one other of Fern Michaels novellas, and also thought that it could have been written by a teenager. I understand that writers take creative liscence, but a story needs a semblance of realism. No stars if I could - one begrudgingly. <br /> <br />2nd Story: Kat Martin - Christmas Angel: Despite having been on opposite sides of the war, Yankee doctor Josh Coltrane is unprepared for the continued bitterness of long-lost love Angel Summers. Can these two former sweethearts learn to forgive and forget the past? <br /> <br />I had high hopes for this one. It has so many elements that I love: it's historical, a civil war story, and reunited lovers. But then I got to the part when some straggling Confederate soldiers try to rape Angel. Josh of course shows up with a gun and saves her. And what does Angel do? She begs him to let her attackers go, because \\"the war made them this way\\". Again, completely unrealistic. I guess the author was just trying to show how understanding and kind she was, but I just didn't buy it. No decent man will rape a woman, no matter what he's been through. They deserved to go to jail for what they did, but they didn't. That disgusted me so much that I again skipped to the next story. Two stars, since it started off well. <br /> <br />3rd Story: Jo Beverly - Twelfth Night: Lady Alice Conyngham was jilted exactly six years ago. Now, at this year's Christmas festival, she must face the scandal of years past and the gentleman to whom she'd given her heart. <br /> <br />One of the better stories in this anthology, and the most \\"Christmassy\\" one. While it's not one I would bother re-reading, it was entertaining. I liked reading about the old traditions, especially the game \\"snapdragon\\". Four stars. <br /> <br />4th Story: Katherine Sutcliffe - Home for Christmas: Virginia Valemere is barely handing on to her prized horses. Her father's desperate need for medical attention may tip her over the edge. Virginia's enigmatic new neighbor Dr. Neil Ellison could wind up being her hope for salvation, or her ruin. <br /> <br />Another so-so story which was not quite as good as the last. Good for one read, but not to re-read. Had the \\"small-town\\" thing going for it, which was quite pleasant. Three stars. <br /> <br />5th Story: Brenda Joyce - The Miracle: In a remote castle on a windswept island, an American beauty challenges a wild Irish nobleman...and finds that after innocence, passion comes -- and a very special Christmas gift.  <br /> <br />Not a very \\"Christmassy\\" story, but the best one of the bunch. This story is written about two minor characters, Lisa Ralston and Julian St. Clare who appeared in \\"After Innocence\\". You do not have to read that story first (I haven't), this story stands very well by itself. Wow! No one can write romantic tension like Brenda Joyce! This was the first of her stories that I read, but it certainly won't be the last. This story was already printed in \\"A Gift of Joy\\", so if you own that already, this is a reissue of that same story. Five stars.	2005-10-14
US	12069684	R66Y1AAU8JATX	0536101450	411104995	English Beyond the Basics: A Handbook (With a Special Focus on Spanish Speakers)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A Tool for Mastering English Basics	English Beyond the Basics is a handbook tailored to the needs of bilingual students.  The text is a thorough analysis of more than 300 errors that Spanish speakers are likely to make while they are in the process of learning to speak and write in English.  Ted Johnston and Joe Old draw from their many years of teaching English in the El Paso/Juarez area.  The book also accommodates ESL students coming from other languages.  The text is clearly organized and coded so that students can find or be directed to the points that need clarification.  The text is made up of explanations, samples of errors, and corrected versions.  The authors have also mixed in a dash of humor, which makes the text more engaging. <br /> <br />English Beyond the Basics is good for me as a composition teacher at El Paso Community College and would be helpful for all teachers who serve bilingual students.  Sometimes we see errors in our students' writing which seem completely off the wall.   Johnston and Old show that those errors have a logical origin because of perceived connections with the writers' native language.  So much of what we teachers perceive as correct grammar has been hardwired into our own computer-like minds.  We may know that one expression is wrong and that another one is right but may not be able to explain exactly why.  Reading English Beyond the Basics can be a form of faculty development.   <br /> <br />  <br />Johnston and Old are good teachers.  Besides the knowledge they present in their books, they also present an attitude and a method that other teachers can learn from.  Instead of getting frustrated or annoyed by odd sentences generated by their students, they take them seriously, just the way they are, and subject those statements to the book's primary assertion: WORDS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY, EVEN IF THEY DON'T THEY SAY WHAT YOU MEAN.  For example, D-1c focuses on the Spanish word \\"ganar\\" and the related concepts of \\"win,\\" \\"beat,\\" and \\"earn\\" in English.  For the erroneous sentence \\"Mary wins Tim every time they play chess,\\" our authors write, \\"Literally, this sentence could mean that Mary wins Tim as a prize, whatever that might mean.  It's probably not what the speaker intends to say.\\"  They then give the correct version: \\"Mary beats Tim every time they play chess.\\" [Although this correct version might also mean that hostile Mary clobbers poor Tim every time they play chess.] For the erroneous sentence \\"Rodrigo wins a lot of money as an architect,\\" the authors write, \\"This could be interpreted to mean that Rodrigo has considerable luck when he enters contests only open to architects, but it does not say what the correct version of the sentence below says.  Correct: Rodrigo earns a lot of money as an architect.\\"  In my own class, we now apply this concept to erroneous statements and often the distinctions stick.   In one essay a student related that someone had broken into his home and robbed the microwave.  We imagined a microwave cowering at gunpoint and giving up its valuables to the intruder.  Words mean what they say even if they don't say what you mean. <br /> <br />English Beyond the Basics is good for bilingual students.  Like all books it works best for serious students.  Any serious student will be able to learn from the sample sentences: the erroneous sentence followed by the correct version.  Over time these serious students would absorb distinctions and correct versions through osmosis, by exposure to lots of English sentences through listening, reading, and conversing.  English Beyond the Basics speeds up the process of mastering all those important little details of English. <br /> <br />There is one special group of students who would benefit the most from the book.  Oftentimes students educated in Mexico or other Latin American countries bring a sophisticated knowledge of grammar with them to the classroom.  They want to figure out how to use prepositions and verb tenses correctly.  They appreciate the comparisons to words and phrases in Spanish.  For them, the book is a bright light to illuminate idiomatic mysteries.  Instead of a one-page treatment of prepositions in a typical writing handbook like A Writer's Reference (Rule T3-f), serious students will find 44 pages,  Chapter 9: entitled Propositions: Establishing the Right Relationships.  In like manner, English Beyond the Basics gives bilingual students more explanations and samples of all the points that beset them as they work to master English. <br /> <br />                                                                                                  <br />	2005-10-14

I have little interest in or knowledge of designer clothes or the fashion world, and I don't subscribe to or read any fashion magazines.  That was exactly why I passed by this book several times before finally picking it up this weekend.  I thought it was going to be some story with a character I couldn't possibly relate to-- someone steeped in fashion who only cared about appearance.   <br /> <br />When I read the first few pages with Andrea IN the designer clothes, I thought I was right... but to my pleasant surprise, the main character turned out to be someone I could relate to and respect.  As a recent college graduate, I know from personal experience that the prospect of finding a job... getting a job... and trying to figure out a career are incredibly common to anyone in the relative age range of 21-24.  It's no easy task to deal with a first \\"real\\" job and the trials it provides while keeping an eye out for what comes next, because, inevitably, there will be a next.  No one stays in their first, entry-level, junky job, but this is a perfect read for the people who ARE in their first, entry-level, junky jobs. <br /> <br />What I found most impressive about this book is the way that, just like Andrea gets sucked into the lifestyle surrounding her job, the reader gets sucked into her goals for the future and how the job will get here there.  Towards the end, even as you realize it's wrong, it's so easy to rationalize (along with Andrea) that this is what she needs to do to secure her future; that she only has a few more weeks left-- all the while knowing deep down that, really, it's totally ridiculous.   <br /> <br />If you've ever had or have a boss who drives you insane for any reason, this is a great book to read because it will show you that your boss is a picnic in the park.  Well worth the read.	2005-10-14

Once more he proves that he is a superb spinner of tales. But in this book he chooses the metaphor of theater to illustrate the funny, the foolish, and the profound stuff of which our lives are made. Deftly, with the skill of the master writer that he is, he weaves together the relationship between the sometimes dramatic, sometimes silly, sometimes tragic occurences that take place behind the floodlights.<br /><br />What makes this book stand apart from his earlier ones is a strong autobiographical section which is revealing, sad, and sometimes outrageously funny. But this is not a \\"funny book.\\" As always with Shelly Kopp, this book instructs. After reading the provacative material in such chapters as \\"Pretend You're Not Pretending,\\" \\"Mis-Casting,\\" \\"The Good Guys,\\" \\"And the Bad Guys,\\" one of the instructions we receive is how to not take ourselves too seriously.  -- from book's dustjacket	2005-10-14

This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to grow spiritually, who wants to live a conscious and compassionate life, and who wants to contribute to world peace. I have read many books on the topic of vegetarianism, animal rights and animal welfare,  spiritual growth, and peace and nonviolence. This book stands alone in its ability to make the connection between all of these subjects. <br /> <br />Will Tuttle, Ph.D. is a rare combination of extraordinary compassion, scholarly research and education, spiritual commitment and wisdom, intuitive insights, and the courage to challenge a worldview which goes back 10,000 years <br />  <br />In this book, Tuttle explores humanity's relationship with the foods we eat.  He points out, very convincingly, that when humans began herding animals, it began to create a consciousness of exploitation which then spread to the control and domination of other humans, as well as animals.  So the roots of human's violence to humans are found in the practice of seeing animals as objects to exploit for our own purposes: for food, furs, labor, entertainment, \\"sport\\" and experimentation. The use of humans as slaves and the subjugation of women followed the subjugation and enslavement of animals. <br /> <br />One thing that sets this book apart from any of the others that describe the problems associated with a meat-based diet is the focus on the spiritual aspects of our diet.  When we take food into our bodies, we are also ingesting the energy contained in this food. Animals that are tortured and filled with terror and agony as they are killed are filled with this very negative energy.  When humans eat their flesh, we are also ingesting this fear and anger. This affects us deeply.  We cannot live with peace in our hearts as long as we are filling our bodies with the pain and suffering of other beings. <br />   <br />Tuttle helps us to see that none of us have actually chosen a diet based upon meat. Our mothers fed us meat from our infancy.As we got old enough to understand that we were eating animals, we were told that animals were put here for us to eat, so it was okay.  We didn't question this, any more than we questioned wearing clothes or taking baths. Thus, we absorbed the acceptance of exploitation of animals so naturally that we didn't know it was happening.  And being unconscious, it is hard to recognize the violence that is part of our everyday lives through the eating of animals.  Therefore, it is also hard to recognize how insensitive we have become to violence, because we have to protect ourselves from an awareness of the violence we are part of 3 times a day.   <br />  <br />This is a very important book for everyone who wants their lives to contribute to more peace in the world, rather than more suffering and violence.  <br />  <br />	2005-10-14

This book is well written, well illustrated and encourging to those of us who might want to try to build an archtop (or any type of stringed instrument). As a beginner, I find that Mr. Benedetto's explanations on the building processes are refreshing and full of encouragement.  While he explains the reasons for selecting top-quality (and expensive) tonewoods, he also demonstrates that a top-quality instrument can be built out of inferior (readily available) woods.  The message I got was: \\"don't wait until all of the conditions are exactly right - work with what you have and overcome your limitations\\" His writing sparks the reader's imagination as to construction methods, jigs and fixtures.  While a moderate amount of woodworking knowledge is assumed, his explanations are clear and concise.  The illustrations are inspiring and make the reader want to run, not walk to the shop to begin work on an instrument. So, Run, don't walk to get this book.

He could be considered a living national treasure, and I feel fortunate to be alive as his contemporary.  His body of work is enormous, his influence immeasurable; his importance cannot be overstated. <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the copyright date of this book, which is 1971 (despite what the information states, this is probably a third edition of the book, but I believe all three editions are identical aside from the cover).  The material is relevent and perennial.  Historical Japan has not changed, and Keene's insights are every bit as valid now as they were when they were set down on paper (most of the material in this book actually predates the 1971 copyright).  The suggested reading list at the back of the book is a superb springboard for further study, should a certain topic particularly amuse the reader, and the listed volumes are also excellent and continue to be highly relevent. <br /> <br />While a new edition is well-purchased at $22, an older edition can be had cheaply.  I personally own the second edition and am quite pleased with it.  I actually find myself here looking for a hardbound version, but, as one does not exist, I must make do with asserting my heartfelt opinion for this volume. <br /> <br />Basically amounting to an Anthology of Keene of sorts, a collection of some of his writings on Japan, it's an invaluable text.  Were I to teach a general class in Japanese culture, this would surely be a book to include; perhaps it would be the only book necessary.  Infinitely readable, inspirational, interesting, and difficult to put down, I couldn't recommend it more highly.   <br /> <br />If my contributions to the study of Japan and the bridging of cultures amount to even a percentage of Keene's, my life will have been quite a productive one. <br /> <br />Another option to pursue is another collection of Keene's writings called, \\"The Blue-Eyed Taroukaja,\\" and its copyright is much more recent.  It's also highly recommended alongside this one.	2005-10-14

O'Keefe and R. R. Reno (both of whom are Associate Professors of Theology at Creighton University), Sanctified Vision: An Introduction To Early Christian Interpretation Of The Bible provides the reader with an informed explanation of the structure and logic of the early Christian interpretations of scripture in late antiquity. These interpretations are considered foundational to the development of Christianity as a religion, and offer insight into how these early leaders and theologians thought about doctrine and practice by analyzing selected portions of patristic exegesis to illustrate specific reading techniques used by them to expound the meaning they believed intrinsic to biblical texts. The approach utilized in Sanctified Vision is organized around three basis analytical strategies: literal, typological, and allegorical. Within this framework, Professors O'Keefe and Reno cogently argue for the importance of this analytic framework and structure in understanding the emergence of what was to become Christian theological orthodoxy. A work of impeccable scholarship and also available in a hardcover edition (0801880874, $45.00), Sanctified Vision will be of immense interest and value to students of Christian Theology, Christian History, and Biblical Studies.	2005-10-14

In typical fashion, the administration responded only when the UCS report gained media attention, and then only to dismiss it as a partisan attack from the left. <br /> <br />Chris Mooney's book documents in plain and incontrovertible fashion why the UCS report was not only non-partisan truth, but significantly understated the case. The current political abuse of science is only the culmination of a consistent strategy fostered by a \\"hard right\\" alliance of corporate and religious conservatives that has gained control of the Republican party since the 1960's. <br /> <br />Corporate attacks on science started with tobacco industry efforts to undermine studies on the health effects of smoking and second-hand smoke. The pattern laid down by the tobacco industry has been consistently followed since: the terms \\"sound science\\" and \\"junk science\\", meaningless in any scientific sense, originated with tobacco lawsuits and have been parlayed by conservatives into codewords for science that respectively supports or threatens \\"conservative\\" ideology. <br /> <br />Mooney categorizes the attacks on science as falling into two main categories. The first of these is an undermining of the processes of science by suppression of information, targeting individual scientists (many of whom work for the government or rely on government grants), or rigging review and advisory committees. The second form these right-wing attacks take is through the communication process to the public after reports are released. This includes \\"spinning\\" the science through misrepresentations or distortions, magnifying uncertainty, relying on and promoting fringe scientists and \\"contrarians\\", and putting scientific clothing on \\"values\\" and ideology. <br /> <br />\\"Manufacturing uncertainty\\" was a key to the tobacco industry strategy that has been repeated again and again on issues from global warming to evolution.  Finding a token scientist to magnify \\"contrarian\\" claims isn't hard: science's health comes from the weathering of constant attacks by those who choose to think differently. But sadly there are also too many scientists willing to distort their own research to conform to the ideologies of funding sources, and a disturbing number of government scientists working for regulatory agencies have been encouraged to alter conclusions of their reports. Mooney notes the sharp distinction in conclusions on the effects of second-hand smoke between industry-funded and independent scientists. <br /> <br />It is one thing to argue and make political decisions based on all the best facts available. That's what we expect our leaders to do. But the right wing attack on science is not satisifed with the facts as they are on the environemnt, biology or medicine. Rather they seek to distort those facts, imposing ideology at an earlier stage, so that decision makers and the public don't even have the truth available to them to make good decisions. <br /> <br />Many of the \\"contrarian\\" scientists who have been selected by the Bush administration to sit on major oversight and advisory panels have very little research background at all. Unfortunately, science's ivory tower makes it far too easy to \\"play scientist\\" for the public - there are no external credentialing mechanisms that effectively separate real experts from impostors. Tellingly, for these political hacks the arguments change with time as the facts on the ground become increasingly inconvenient to their ideology. Denial of global warming becomes denial of human causation, now morphing into assertion that global warming will be good for us. Creationism becomes \\"intelligent design\\". <br /> <br />The broad range of regulatory and scientific areas where the same anti-science tactics have been used forces the conclusion that this is more than separate isolated incidents. Similar issues with failed intelligence on 9-11 and Iraq's WMD, and other apparent efforts to conceal the facts on the ground by the administration imply this pattern of ideological decision making extends far beyond  the areas where science is the central source of facts. <br /> <br />There are examples of liberal science abuse too, where individuals are tempted to spin the facts to fit their ideology. Mooney cites a few cases, but the only systematic pattern seems to be one of exaggeration of direct effects and perhaps denial of uncertainty. Of the examples in question, almost all show liberal statements to be much closer to the scientific facts than the right-wing spin on the same issues. Even so, neither side should try to twist science to their benefit, and to his credit Mooney does criticize both. <br /> <br />The book has a few flaws: there are occasional jarring repetitions of previous arguments that suggest chapters were rewritten several times in mid-stream, without reconsidering the book as a whole. Mooney also seems reluctant to state as baldly as possible what's going on here: some people are lying about the facts, and as a result, other people are dying needlessly. Isn't there legal recourse for such fraud, as happened in the case of tobacco? <br /> <br />Mooney makes a number of sensible suggestions beyond legal action: reinstate the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, pass legislation to bar political litmus tests for committees, roll back the \\"sound science\\" regulatory reform that has done so much harm. More skepticism and understanding of the processes of science from journalists would be a big help, as would some reforms in the science community itself.  But as he also points out, significant change will be impossible in our democracy as long as the current ideologues hold all the strings of power. Getting the information out somehow and persuading the public to vote for moderates instead of ideologues is the most important thing we can do - will it be enough?	2005-10-14

This was just the kind of romance novel I love. Wonderful characters. Characters that seem real because they are not perfect-something most novels like this lack. There are interesting plot twists and we get to know several secondary characters well. The secondary characters are not boring. The chemistry between Brianna and Michael was very sensual and immediate. The heroine is the perfect foil for the hero's cynicism and intellect. It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with both the palatable passion and the keen sense of danger infused in the story. Brianna and Michael were both wounded, intriguing, complex, wonderful characters. The action/suspense was fast-paced and thrilling. The setting was beautiful and exotic. The sex was HOT and perfect for the story. Melody Thomas stories are humorous, romantic and interesting - and she is excellent and creating characters that are real, interesting people - and that you remember vividly from book to book throughout the series. You want to know them better! I love the Donally family. This is the second book I have read from Melody Thomas and I love them both. I'm looking forward to reading more about the Donally family. All I can say in conclusion is if you like a good, emotional, heart-tugging historical, with characters that leap off the pages, buy  Must Have Been The Moonlight.	2005-10-14

I had heard of Eudora Welty, only because of this book, which won her the Pulitzer Prize. <br /> <br />I was not dissapointed for the following reasons: <br />1. The book is concise.  Sometimes it is nice to get through a book in 3 hours rather than 3 weeks, or like some that really drag, 3 months.   <br />2. The prose is wonderful, the descriptions colorful.  The storyline is simple, I could summarize the storyline in 3 sentences or less, but what was remarkable was the beauty of the writing and the short, descriptive paragraphs which made me go back and reread a few which I thought were particularly poignant. <br />3. The storyline, although simple, is interesting. I could relate to Laurel; I could see the old house and recognize all the neighbors as they came to her father's wake.  I am surprised it has not been made into a movie. (or has it?)  <br />4. The storyline and writing style reminded me of 'A Summons to Memphis\\" by Peter Taylor, another Southern writer. <br /> <br />If you are looking for action packed, this book isn't it.

Countless Americans patiently trace genealogies and histories through slowly crumbling archives and weathering marble, seeking answers to questions about the ones who preceded us.   This is a story of the meaning of such a search to one searcher.  As the book's title alludes, Recovering Ruth: A Biographer's Tale focuses on how recovering Ruth Edgerton Douglass' history affects her biographer, Robert Root.  Parts of Ruth's journal are excerpted in Recovering Ruth, and those who are interested in reading her journal in its entirety can look to Time by Moments Steals Away: The 1848 Journal of Ruth Douglass, edited by Robert Root.  <br /> Root's task, as the book begins, is seemingly simple and straightforward: edit the 1848 journal of Mrs. C. C. Douglass for publication.  The Michigan library catalog attributes the authorship to Lydia Douglass, the clan matriarch who lived to be an octogenarian.  However, Root soon discovers that the journal was actually penned by the first Mrs. C. C. Douglass, Ruth Edgerton Douglass.  This discovery compels him to reconstruct the people and places of the mid-nineteenth century Michigan frontier, from the then-booming young city of Detroit to the remote Lake Superior outpost, Isle Royale.  Although his search begins in libraries and archives, he soon journeys to the places where Ruth triumphed over fears common to us all: loneliness, hardships, and loss.  <br /> In retracing her life's journey, Root travels from Detroit to Chicago to Lake Superior's Isle Royale. Root uses his carefully researched details to evoke the Michigan Ruth would have known.  He describes their approach of Isle Royale thus: \\"At last the island begins to rise in the distance, a long thin line above the water that slowly thickens as we thump our way steadily across the waves\\" (109).  His language not only shows the vastness of the Great Lake, but also the treachery and danger inherent in crossing the world's largest freshwater lake even for a modern traveler.  Imagery such as this gives us insight into the courage and determination of settlers such as the Douglasses. <br /> During the course of his timely yet timeless search, Root comes to realize that he is in search of the meaning not only of Ruth's life, but of his own.  As Root says, \\"Perhaps I needed to recover Ruth in order to keep from losing myself\\" (xvi).  History is comprised of a series of chance meetings and fortunate accidents not readily apparent by perusing a family tree.  Our lives would be immeasurably different if our great-grandparents had decided that it was, after all, too difficult to make their way by wagon train westward to Kansas, if our grandmother had stayed home rather than attended a dance, if our father's soulful brown eyes hadn't met our mother's at a crowded wedding.  Root directly acknowledges those subconscious murmurs: \\"Genealogy identifies lines of descent, who begat whom, the aftermath of events; what it doesn't recount are the myriad alternatives barely missed, the intangibles of attraction and attachment, the possibilities avoided, ignored, or rejected\\" (25).  In recovering Ruth's story, Root sees the ways in which his own choices will impact the future course of history: a painful divorce, a hopeful remarriage, his beloved children.   <br /> Root's work serves as a window for us to view the interconnections between our world and Ruth's.  As George Eliot wrote at the end of Middlemarch, \\"the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.\\"  In Recovering Ruth, Root has recorded Ruth's historic acts and unveiled her hidden life.    <br />     This book was chosen by the Library of Michigan as a 2004 Michigan Notable Book.	2005-10-14

I would say only that before Hard Time John was a bastard, but he always seemed at least a little sorry for it. With Azrillo, the wishy washyness slipped completely away to reveal John for the conniving, sadistic unapologetic bastard everybody always thought he was. <br />Which isn't to say I liked Azrillo. He did horrible things to the character and the supporting cast, but in many ways his mark has been left. <br />If Carey's first collection, Red Sepulchre, attempted to crawl out of the ditch Hellblazer was left in, Black Flowers represents Carey, not to use an obvious metephor, in full bloom. <br />I expected great things from Carey the moment I heard he was takeing the reigns. Judging from the complex, continuing storylines of Lucifer, I figured this for a man who dreams up issues years ahead of schedule. <br />Yet for all its achievments with reoccuring plot threads, Hellblazer has never been much for one long, linked storyline. Until now... <br />I would not have believed he would try to tie in Red Sepulchre, in itself an impressive storyline, with anything larger. But in this I committed the inexcusible sin of underestimating Mike Carey. In this collection, he takes up the tone of his other magnificent works and makes Hellblazer unmistakably his own, without oweing apologies to anyone else. <br />His work is not at all choppy, each episode proceeds naturally into the next. But don't mistake continous and flowing for predictable, Carey is also the master of dropping little hints that never make sense until the puzzle is assembled. And then you realize what you thought of as the whole puzzle is but a piece of something larger. That is the joy. <br />But I'm rambling. The two-part title arc is perhaps the most other-wordly story I have read in some time, and the Three Doors story arc represents John at his con-man best. Nothing is ever as it seems, and Carey presents just enough information to let you think youknow what's going on. When all is said and done, you feel like you should have known what was going to happen, but you never can. <br />And the best is yet to come. Judging by the hints dropped in this book, and the way they simply beg for more information, Black Flowers will have Hellblazer fans and lovers of mystery and dark fantasy stories pleading for more. <br />Mike Carey is just getting started.	2005-10-14

It was an ok read but it just isn't as good as the anime and I felt like the storyline was a little rushed in this manwha.  The main reason why I gave this manwha two stars is because of the English release.  Even though the manwha is unflipped as it should be, Tokyopop still uses the dub names and although the translation is more accurate than the anime's dub, they still inserted some sarcastic jokes in the dialog.  I don't mind the sarcastic humor in the anime's dub (I actually kind of like it), but I think with manga and manwha, the translation should be as accurate as possible instead of trying to make your own dialog up.  At least the artwork is good and visual-wise, the manwha is uncut.  If this was released back when Tokyopop was still called Mixxzine and when they were still releasing flipped manga because they were something that was new, I might have been more forgiving about the quality of the English release, but there's no excuse in this day and age where fans know Tokyopop can put out better releases than this.  If you're a diehard Digimon fan and don't mind a little inaccurate translation, then it wouldn't be a bad choice for you to buy this.  But if you're more of a casual fan who only wants the best English translations, then you should just pass this up, since it's just a retelling of the anime, anyway.	2005-10-14

But for me at least, this remains the least fun of all those junior high masterpieces.<br /><br />The animals at Manor Farm have had enough of Mr. Jones' despotic rule. Inspired by the deathbed speech of the prize pig Major, they rebel and kick the farmer and his wife out, rename their home \\"Animal Farm,\\" and declare they will henceforth not have any interaction with humans, creating an animal utopia that will hopefully inspire other farm animals in England, Ireland, and points beyond.<br /><br />\\"Animal Farm\\" is a short book, told as an allegorical fable, and Orwell's tone in telling his tale seems exactly right, depicting without emotion the gradual corruption of this supposed paradise. The novel presents clear parallels to the then-existing situation in the U.S.S.R. and contains a dead-on attack on its despotic leader, Josef Stalin, here presented as an opportunistic pig named Napoleon who bends the animal's classless utopia to his own self-aggrandizing ends.<br /><br />The book holds up today, long after the toppling of Soviet communism, because it's an elastic comment on how those hungry for power can manipulate altruistic ideals with the help of shameless propaganda and a population that is either fooled into believing its leaders, or too cowed to do much more than mutter about them.<br /><br />Most of the fun I get from \\"Animal Farm\\" is in the form of trying to guess what specific characters and events are meant to represent. Major seems to be based on Karl Marx, while Snowball, the pig who leads the Revolution before being betrayed and exiled by Napoleon, seems to combine the early Soviet revolutionaries Lenin and Trotsky. You can quibble with some of Orwell's apparent parallels, like the strained interaction between Napoleon and the neighboring farms, meant to suggest Hitler's Germany and Chamberlain's England. Stalin, for all his faults, didn't completely overturn the Soviet ideals he inherited.<br /><br />But he does get an awful lot right. It's noteworthy that the corruption of the Revolution begins even before Snowball's ouster, when we learn about the fate of the milk and the pigs' appropriation of the apples for themselves, a rare point of agreement between Napoleon and Snowball. While Stalin is the focus of Orwell's scorn, clearly he sensed something was rotten in the situation up front, before the purges and show trials.<br /><br />Except for the part when the pigs discover booze, \\"Animal Farm\\" lacks humor. More problematically, the characters lack sympathetic dimension, even the noble horse Boxer. Orwell wants us to get the point Boxer represents the dim-witted common man, bending himself to Napoleon's will, but since he has little to say except \\"I will work harder\\" and \\"Napoleon is always right,\\" it's hard to care about his sad fate, or that of the others.<br /><br />Orwell was a brilliant man, but a depressing one, and that holds true here. Orwell later called \\"Animal Farm\\" his attempt \\"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole,\\" but my one caveat with this otherwise terrific book is that the political accomplishment clearly outweighs the artistic.nt parallels, like the strained interaction between Napoleon and the neighboring farms, meant to suggest Hitler's Germany and Chamberlain's England.

These options should:   (a) simplify Federal tax laws to reduce the costs and administrative burdens of compliance with such laws;     Looks like the Tax Relief morons will add to the cost for some and provide no compliance cost relief for the rest of us. - FAILED   F-    FAIR TAX - read the book - PASS A++    (b) share the burdens and benefits of the Federal tax structure in an appropriately progressive manner while recognizing the importance of homeownership and charity in American society; and     They achieved the opposite by reducing incentive to buy an expensive home for those that can afford it  and not giving the lower-middle class and poor a huge break on price with no tax for purchasing a used home, not to mention no relief for charity contributions, in a time when Americans are giving more than ever. - FAILED F-    FAIR TAX - again, read the book - PASS A++    (c) promote long-run economic growth and job creation, and better encourage work effort, saving, and investment, so as to strengthen the competitiveness of the United States in the global marketplace.     Wow, what idiots, they must of forgot about this one too. Their recommendation does not address this objective in any shape, form or fashion - FAILED F-    FAIR TAX - its in the book - PASS A++    I don't know, I don't think Americans deserve any Tax Relief. Most of us walk around clueless and indifferent to what goes on in Washington. We'd rather focus on Hollywood. We readily accept a feeling of powerlessness that mocks the blood, sweat and tears that were sacrificed for our freedom.     Yeah, read the book, sit back and hope that someone does something to make it happen so your life will be easier because I know most that do read the book, even those that agree, will not write their Senators or Congressmen and tell them their job is on the line if they don't get behind this idea.

Wanted in three states for various felonies, he found himself on a plane heading towards Chicago, with a broken nose, bloodied eyes, wounds on his cheeks, four teeth were missing, and basically no recollection of what happened. His parents met him at the airport and they drove him to the rehab center. In rehab, James wrote about the gruelling headaches and vomits, the difficulty of concentrating and just plain difficult. There, he became friends with a Las Vegas mobster, a judge, an administrator of a Catholic university and a former prostitute.  <br /> <br />This book is extremely disturbing and raw. James Grey was extremely graphic in his description of pain and suffering. He described having gone through root canal surgeries on two of his teeth without any medication and the picture that he painted was one very mesmerizing and yet disturbing. He was successful in describing his days in the rehab and his slow but successful completion of the program. I would not recommend this to anyone as it was very graphic and contained lots of expletives.	2005-10-14

Welsh is a wonderful, ancient language that has survived on the fringe of the island of Great Britain despite the dominance of its now world-wide-dominant neighbour, English.  The literary works, particularly the poetry, has great power, even when translated into English, and English speakers can get a sense of the flavour of this Celtic language from the various worlds that have been absorbed into English.<br /><br />This course created by T. J. Rhys Jones (about as Welsh a name as they come) is a very easy, step-by-step process to learn what is in many ways a very difficult language - particularly for English speakers, whose language comes from Germanic and Latinate roots, going to a Celtic language which stems from a different tree is truly an excursion into foreign territory.  Rhys Jones has made this trip quite enjoyable, and quite do-able.<br /><br />Unlike English, Welsh pronunciation is a lot less flexible in terms of matching spelling to sound, so learning the pronunciation is a bit easier to do.  The grammar seciont also looks at the way words are put together - like many languages, there are colloquial expressions and multi-word phrases that stand in for single English words, and vice-versa.  Each unit starts with a brief dialogue, which is then analysed for vocabulary and for grammar structure, and any other points of interest.<br /><br />There is also an introductory section on mutations, the shift of a sound from one to another depending upon use - Rhys Jones gives the examples of road signs:  the word for Wales is Cymru, but a border sign when crossing into Wales might read Croeso i Gymru; similarly, the word for England is Lloegr, but the sign might read Croeso i Loegr.  This is a codification in letters of what happens in regular speech - we do not as a rule stop and start between each word, and the spelling in Welsh takes this into account.<br /><br />There are a few difficulties with the text. While Rhys Jones indicates that there are dialect differences, some of the words don't match what I heard while in Wales in any location.  As with any language text, I am more often to account the difficulty to myself than to the author of the instructional text.<br /><br />There is a glossary of words in the back, but I often found myself wishing it were a fuller dictionary rather than a simple word list.  There are exercises to work through, whose translations are found in the appendix, as well as more detailed tables on mutations, gender in language constructions, the special verb 'have', which in Welsh can be variously translated as gyda, cael, wedi, or rhaid.<br /><br />This is a useful text; used in connection with travel or a book of poetry (Dafydd ap Gwilym is one of my favourite poets).dialect differences, some of the words don't match what I heard while in Wales in any location.

Reviewers all over the country wrote reviews about how great it was. The initial sales were fantastic. It went immediately to a book club. Published in 18 (last I heard) countries. That was in the early summer of 2005. Switch to early fall. I see lots of places with the book for sale saying 'Publisher's Overstock.'  <br /> <br />John Twelve Hawks, the author, supposedly lives 'off the grid.' That is, no permanent address, no credit cards, no Social Security number, etc. Question -- how does he get paid royalties? For the publisher to pay him, they are going to want to deduct that expense on their taxes. To do that they have to have a Social Security number, a corporate ID, or possible make the payment to a foreign national in their own country. It's still good hype to have the author remain quite mysterious - no interviews, no book tour, no e-mail. He communicates only through his agent via scrambled-signal satellite telephone. How is the satellite phone account paid for?  <br /> <br />Anyway, the story. This book, the first of a trilogy, sets up a fight between the forces of light and darkness that is happening behind the scenes, off the grid if you wish.  <br /> <br />The bad guys are the Tabula. They're sort of like the Patriot Act run amok.  <br /> <br />The good guys are the Harlequins - no they don't write romance novels. They run around with swords in what I envision as  a 'Kill Bill' environment and fight the Tabula.  <br /> <br />Inbetween are the Travelers who have an ability to project their spirit into other worlds where they can receive wisdom to bring back to earth.	2005-10-14

This is the most concise and easily understood book on transfer factors that I have read, and I have been studying the subject extensively in recent years. Because of its clarity and the visual reinforcement of simple charts, I have given multiple copies of this book away to friends and loved ones. To me, it makes a \\"cerebral\\" subject very compelling reading.    It first sets forth the case for our need of immune system strengthening in this 21st century.  It then covers the history of the discovery of transfer factors, what they are, why they are vitally & profoundly important to our immune health, and what medical conditions can benefit from immune boosting and/or modulation. The author finishes by summarizing some of the non-toxic herbal compounds which can enhance transfer factors for an immune impact far beyond anything we've seen before.    It concludes with a glossary and 5 pages of transfer factor research references, showing at least the tip of the iceberg on the research behind transfer factors up until the time of this writing in 2001. You will find more recent research results on transfer factors in Dr William Hennen's book, \\"Enhanced Transfer Factors\\" - UPDATED 3rd Edition, 2005.     If this is your first exposure to information on transfer factors, I believe you will be amazed and fascinated as Master Herbalist, Rita Elkins -  daughter of an MD - unfolds the story of this safe, effective immune support molecule whose time has definitely come.

This is where it all began, one small book, supposedly marketed at pre-teens, released to an uncertain reception, not yet the worldwide hit it was destined to become. What worthy person can possibly be immune to the charm here? An orphan who is secretly heir to great powers, fame, fortune, escape into another, more interesting world... There are universal themes here, of course, heroism, villainy, mystery, a quest, a hidden inheritance, clandestine passages within a great foreboding castle, but there is also much that is new. J.K. Rowling's creation is so inventive and fun it's no wonder it's brought as much joy into the world as it has. I unapologetically love this book even though I'm twice the age of its supposed target audience, and I've read and re-read it since I first got it several years ago. I think Harry Potter, his friends, enemies, and their world are extraordinarily special, and I hope they entrance the minds and warm the hearts of readers for generations yet to come.	2005-10-14

DO NOT BE FOOLED AS I WAS! I ordered this study guide in preparation for the ASE tests that I was going to be taking this fall.  This guide is very poorly put together and NOT EVEN PROOFREAD apparently...it's a complete joke!  Let me give you a few examples of why this is a HUGE waste of your money. <br /> <br />First of all, as you may or may not already know the ASE test questions are copyrighted and therefore CANNOT be reproduced.  This means that the \\"sample questions\\" in this guide are not ACTUAL ASE questions, but rather questions that the author of the book made up that are designed to be similar in style to the ones you would see on a real ASE exam.  ALL study guides are this way, which is fine so long as the person making up the questions is somewhat competent...the person who wrote this book IS NOT COMPETENT.  Many of the questions are quite misleading, and some of the answers are just plain wrong! EVEN according to the information that THEY THEMSELVES give in the study guide! <br /> <br />There are so many typo's and mistakes in this book I got the feeling I was reading a book report written by my 3rd grade sister.   <br /> <br />Each sample question is SUPPOSEDLY linked (by way of a reference number with a corresponding section) back to the section that explains how to do the procedure from which the question was based.  THERE WERE SEVERAL SAMPLE QUESTIONS THAT LINKED BACK TO A SECTION IN THE BOOK THAT DIDN'T EVEN EXIST!!!!! I mean, how frustrating is that! <br /> <br />And then there is this hoopla that they sell you on about having \\"explanations for each sample question telling why the correct answer is right as well as why the wrong answers are wrong.\\"  WHAT A QUACK!  A typical example of one of the sample questions and their \\"detailed explanation\\" for it would go something like this: <br /> <br />Question: <br />Technician A says [blah, blah, blah]. Technician B says [yada yada yada]. Who is correct? <br /> <br />a. Technician A <br />b. Technician B<br />c. Both Technicians A and B are correct <br />d. Neither Technician A or B is correct <br /> <br />Explanation: <br />a. The correct answer is a. \\"technician A is correct\\" <br />b. Answer B is not correct: [restates what technician B said WORD FOR WORD here] is not correct. [WHAT THE CRAP KIND OF EXPLANATION IS THAT???????!!!!!!] <br />c. Answer C is not correct because technician B is incorrect. <br />d. Answer D is not correct because technician A is correct. <br /> <br />WOULD THIS NOT FRUSTRATE YOU TOO WITH YOUR TESTS FAST APPROACHING? <br /> <br />Anyway, the first ASE study guide that I bought was a MITCHELL1 series study guide....after becoming very frustrated at the quality of the study guide I decided to purchase a different brand, so I went with the DELMAR series study guide and MUCH TO MY DISMAY when it arrived I found that it was THE EXACT SAME BOOK as the MITCHELL1!!!!  BUYERS BEWARE!!! Apparently DELMAR learning bought out MITCHELL, as well as CHILTON repair books companies and now has some sort of monopoly on the whole market.  It's sickening really...not because of the monopoly so much, but because DELMAR puts out such horrible products.   <br /> <br />Anyway, I just thought I would give you all the heads up so you do not make the same mistake I did....when I bought the book there were no reviews on it so after my experience I thought SOMEBODY needs to expose this JUNK for what it is.  I would put the company out of business if I could.  DO everyone a favor...spread the word around that DELMAR does NOT sell good products!  <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

Dr. Watson gives his deductions, and we as the reader can see how Dr. Watson's deductions make sense.  Then Holmes says Watson is all wrong, and gives his deductions, which prove to be correct.<br /><br />The background for this story is hundreds of years ago a Hugo Baskerville got drunk with some friends, and chased a local peasant girl out into the moors with his hounds.  Since that time many of the Baskervilles have died unpleasant deaths.  Many in the family believe there is a curse.<br /><br />Dr. Mortimer, the owner of the walking stick, brings the latest events of a tragedy where Charles Baskerville has died under mysterious circumstances.

The writing though seemingly well-researched (as far as the cast of characters is concerned) is simplistic and insulting to an adult reader with more than a 6th grade education.  Her theory on the mystery is contrary to most published accounts and so offers a fresh perspective, yet it is an improbable and honey-coated approach to a great mystery and likely terrible crime.

After a while they get really close and end up getting physical with one another.  This wasn't the smartest idea of the two because Jon's parents don't like Dulcie and don't want them to be together.  A couple of days after their contact with one another Dulcie ended up being pregnant.  Dulcie tells Jon and Jon tells his parents, and they throw him out of the house.  Well Sara thinks they should get an abortion but Dulcie and Jon want to have it.  Dulcie and Jon end up out on their own. Read the book and you will know the ending.

Hutton reveals how football was not quite the all-encompassing passion that most band members claim and that tales of a rabble-rousing youth were frequently exaggerated. <br /> <br />The gigantic impact of the Stone Roses, Madchester and Spike Island prompted Hutton to form the Rain with Guigsy, Bonehead and Tony McCarroll. Hutton recounts the early days of the band and shows how this period was vital to the development of the Oasis sound. And Chris tells how his friends unceremoniously dropped him from the band to make way for Liam and Noel Gallagher and describes what it was like to be left behind, watching the others change as they progressed from anonymity to stardom. <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

Or, in this case by opinion only with no firsthand experience. I am currently studying with Alberto Villoldo through The Four Winds Society. Alberto will be the first to tell you that you must experience this to really understand and I will attest to that in full measure. The experiences and healing and wisdom of this system are profound. Having been a student and practitioner of alternative modalities since I was 15, I can attest to the fact that this system is like no other - and it works, as quickly as one is able to assimilate the process. Nothing else I tried, including traditional therapy - it only made things worse - has been able to fully release the deep seated issues of the extremely hostile enviroment I was born into and lived surrounded by for the first 30+ years of my life. If you are truly ready to be fully alive and free of the past - this will take you there in a graceful manner. And, it is fun as well as extremely effective. He also does not exclude useful modern medicine, there is a time and place for both.	2005-10-14

Virtually nothing goes right for the poor human and ilderan characters.  The chain of unlikly setbacks some of these characters endure are second only to the plotlines in the TV series 24 in inprobability. Whats worse, our hero's reactions are totally ineffective, their strategies irrational.  I can only assume Anderson is planning on some alien rescuers like the Wentals to bail them out. <br /> <br />Another problem with the books as they progress is how much time Anderson spends rehashing events that have already happened.  It seems like every event has to be first described, and then reminisced about by a character at least twice before he is satisfied we caught the even't significance! <br /> <br />All that said, this series has kept my interest, I do enjoy it, but I think Anderson could have done a lot better.  There are many things that don't make sense in the book, like how these civilizations  could accomplish much of anything with no faster-than light communications.  I guess any ship whose star drive happens to break down is just out of luck.  Also, the stupidity displayed by the supposedly tactical and sharp minded Ad'ar Zahn is really frustrating.  Overall, the good side in these novels seem incapable of any real innovation or capability to drive events, they merely react mechanically.  Only rarely do they display creativity. <br /> <br />Making matters much worse for this audiobook, there is a different, and far less talented reader.  Apparently this guy took over without bothering to listen to any of George Guidall's recordings.  Most of the place and character names are pronounced differently.  The roamers now all seem to come from the american deep south, and sound both stupid and ridiculous as a result.  The Ilderans talk in maddening fake english accents.  The readers attempts at both gruff, gravely voices and female voices come off pretty pathetic as well.  Since one of mymain motivations for listening to this series was Guidall's comforting rythms, this book has been painful at times. <br /> <br />I would still recommend this book however, just because it is relatively easy to skip through the utterly mechanical and predictable, or repetitive parts because the chapters are arranged by character.  Sometimes it becomes easy to predit what will happen in a given chapter and just skip it if it will be too painful to read. <br /> <br />If your a person that demands better written books, or needs a more positive storyline, I'd steer clear.  On the other hand if you enjoy tragedy and psychology, as well as interesting aliens and a good sense of the unknown, I would recommend this book to you.	2005-10-14

Anthony was a special guest at one of his shows? And those are just a few of the details in this book that are not even central to the story line.

As is becoming a trend in Salvatore books from an author that simply can't let go of a character Artemis Entreri, the same Artemis Entreri that was supposed to have died...twice...    Despite it's miscomings later on, the book actually begins rather well: Bruenor is crushed at the loss of Wulfgar, Drizzt is concerned about the Dark Elves intentions, and Catti Brie is still trying to figure out what to do with herself since she thought she was already going to be married by this book.     The book can be essentially broken down into two main plots: Drizzt/Catti Brie in Mithril Hall and Drizzt/Catti Brie/Artemis Entreri in Menzoberranzan. The first plot is strong and really builds on the characters. The second is simply a series of challenges for the trio which increase in intensity with the climactic moment being so over the top as to really catapult all 3 of these characters into the realm of fantasy Superheroes: they are invincible and unscated in the face of overwhelming odds.    Drizzt's ruminations as he decides to make the trip to his former homeland are where Salvatore is really able to bring about the overconfidence of his main character, an overconfidence which is built on well throughout this book. Drizzt's eventual capture and torture were fantastic opportunities for Salvatore to begin to show the real inner strength and, finally, limitations of Drizzt. Instead, this is where the book begins to slide down into the realm of superhero comicbook farce.     From the rescue of Drizzt by Artemis and Catti Brie to the Epilogue the trio faces simply impossible odds and still manages to escape the jaws of Menzoberranzan without a single scrape and quite a bit of loot to boot. With the whirling scimitars of Drizzt, the whirling knives of Artemis, and the unlimited ammo, ballista shotgun that is the bow of Cattie Brie (oh ya, she also now has a sword that can cut through stone and probably solid steel too): the trio are simply invincible.    I can't really place it, but I've lost some respect for these books after reading this one. I know going in what to expect: a relatively light read with some dramatic moments. I know that the main characters are all going to come back at some point because Salvatore just can't let them go. Despite this, I feel this story really is missing something. Perhaps it borders on being too fantastical, perhaps it's the overly dramatic moments which really don't come across well, or maybe it's just that the fight scenes in the previous two series just seemed a lot more gritty.     What I think it basically boils down to is there's only so many times where you can see characters go through hell and come back out before it loses it's novelty.	2005-10-14

I'm a big fan of the forensic programs on Court TV, and I always check the date of the featured crime (almost always murder and/or rape) to see if it occurred before or after DNA testing became common in the United States.  If it occurred after 1992, the perp is usually doomed. Even decades-old cases can be solved if blood/semen/saliva samples were properly stored from the crime scene.  According to a prophecy in the weekly \\"New Scientist,\\" there will soon be kits available that will allow police to process DNA samples in less than two hours.<br /><br />In \\"The Blooding,\\" former policeman, Joseph Wambaugh writes about the first serial killer who was caught and convicted through the use of DNA testing:  two teenage girls in the English village of Narborough were brutally raped and murdered in 1983 and 1986, and it took four years, a scientific breakthrough, and the blood of 5,000 men to capture the killer, Colin Pitchfork.  DNA testing also freed the suspect who police had already jailed for the crime.<br /><br />On September 10, 1984, at nearby Leicester University, Dr. Alec Jeffreys (now Sir Alec) discovered that each human being (except for identical twins) has a unique genetic profile.  At first, his DNA profiling technique was used to sort out immigration cases. Then the Leicestershire constabulary became familiar with DNA 'fingerprinting' and collected blood from over 5,000 men in the ultimately successful search for their murderer.<br /><br />(By 2004, the UK had a national database of 2.5 million genetic profiles from convicted criminals.  Statistics show that 38% of all crimes are detected where DNA has been loaded onto the UK national database, compared with a 24% detection rate overall.  And 48% of burglaries are detected where DNA has been loaded onto the database, compared with a 14% detection rate for burglaries overall.<br /><br />Nowadays, even British bus drivers are issued DNA testing kits to help catch passengers who spit at them.)<br /><br />Wambaugh does not spend much time exploring the scientific aspects of the Narborough Village murders.  He tells the interwoven stories of the victims, their families, the murderer, and most especially the policemen who were involved in the hunt.<br /><br />From the shadowy paths that wound past the grounds of the local psychiatric hospital to the ancient, smoke-filled pubs where the villagers spent their free hours, this author will have you living and breathing the horror of these crimes.  There are a few of the patented Wambaugh belly laughs as the Leicestershire police invent their own techniques for 'blooding' the local men.

She made the comment that she could \\"shoot John the Baptist through the eye in the painting of the Last Supper.\\"  As any good art expert (or Roman Catholic) would know, St. John the Baptist was not in Da Vinci's Last Supper; he was executed before Jesus even began his public ministry. <br /> <br />Despite this glaring error, Patterson had many twists and turns that kept me listening to this CD.  Just when I thought I had the whole story figured out, the plot twisted just enough to throw me off.

Yes, I passed the test but not with the score I thought I would receive.  I ended up with a disappointed 794.  I read this book as well as the Exam Cram book thoroughly.  In addition, I have four year experience as a PC technician.  One might then inquire as to why the low score.  The answer is this:  the 70-270 test does not solely test your knowledge on Windows XP alone, as it should since there are separate tests for server, network management, active directory, etc.  You must have experience with Windows 2000/2003 server and Active Directory to get anything above an 850.  You will need to have an understanding of Group Policy (which is a server topic), Login Scripts (also a server topic) and Active Directory (which is a separate test itself).  Fortunately, I was able to get through it from the minimal experience I received from setting up a practice LAN with 2003 server with Active Directory installed.  However, I did not think that I would be tested on Windows Server or Active Directory, therefore, didn't study them.  If one were just to study this book as well as Exam Cram with no experience with 2000/2003 server, they would surely fail the test.  However, if you want to have a descent insight into XP Professional, this is a great book.	2005-10-14

This is actually too soon for this review to be written -- I've only been pursuing the stretches (exercises) for a little over a month now.<br /><br />  On the plus side, I believe I can credit this book with helping me get through the last week or so -- in addition to a cold, I ended up dealing with back, leg, and shoulder problems after a day of tree cutting and trimming, another day of construction work on the house, and a third day of helping our grown children prepare their pool for winter storage, which included letting cold water run over my feet for two hours.  I've suffered from short hamstrings for most of my life, a condition that was finally diagnosed just last year, and any one of those days (besides the cold) would have previously put me in bed for at least a day.  The combination should have put me in hospital for at least four days.  Not to say that I didn't have problems, but thanks in part to techniques and stretches from Mr. Cooley's book, I managed to stay active and motile, and have now almost fully recovered.<br /><br />  To the negative, it could be that Mr. Cooley puts too much stock in his own discoveries, and he is certainly too used to working with people with already-developed athletic capabilities.<br /><br />  First, \\"too much stock in his own discoveries.\\"  The first section of the book describes how Bob Cooley survived a near-death experience, and how he came upon his stretching techniques while recovering for that experience.  I have not yet walked his path long enough to deliver a real judgement, but I suspect that part of the benefits he ascribes to his techniques is actually a normal part of his return trip from death's door.<br /><br />  This is not to say that there is no value in his stretching techniques, but rather that they may not be the \\"univeral fix-everything\\" he represents them to be.<br /><br />  The second negative is that I find his presentation better suited to those who are already developed athletically rather than the majority of us who are somewhat motion impared.  By his own statement, Mr. Cooley discovered his first stretching techniques while attempting a middling-advanced yoga position. His book also includes testimonies from several world-class athletes, which I certainly would not dispute.  However, I had to invent several \\"remedial\\" stretches before even attempting the beginning series of stretches presented in his book (fortunately I have some theraputic streching and hatha yoga in my background), and a few of the illustrations for the beginning stretches seem misleading if not plain wrong.  The intermediate and advanced series appear to be correct, as far as I can currently tell.<br /><br />  Mr. Cooley's basic premise is that first, streching is good and second, stretching against resistance is better.  Theroretically this makes sense, since then all the cells in a muscle would elongate rather than just those involved at the muscle's maximum extension.  Also, \\"resistence stretching\\" is very similar to what most of us do naturally just before or after arising from bed.  However, as noted in the book, the \\"immediate strength\\" of a muscle will decline if only his stretching techniques are used.  Again this makes sense -- from my observation, the existing strength of a muscle becomes \\"spread\\" over the entire range of motion for that muscle, and as the muscle cells and fibers elongate, the \\"new\\" portion of them is weak until strengthened through other forms of exercise.  In fairness, the book points out that the stretches can be turned into strength building exercises by reversing their direction, but the follow-through on this concept is weak.<br /><br />  I don't feel qualified to comment on whether his claimed connection between his exercise cycles and the \\"meridians\\" of traditional Chinese medicine is valid.  I do know that, while many of his positions approximate those of hatha yoga, the muscle groups involved don't necessarily correspond -- for example, the \\"child\\" position in both yoga and western rehabilitation therapy focuses on the lower back and Mr. Cooley uses it to stretch the upper back, shoulders and arms.  Not necessarily wrong, mind you, but a much different emphasis.  Also, the beginning series doesn't quite involve ALL of the muscle groups, at least as I understand them.<br /><br />  In summary:  The book's main feature is \\"resistance stretching\\" (which might also be described as isometrics in motion).  While not the universal panacea it's presented to be, the concept IS quite useful and beneficial. It should be used in addition to other exercise techniques, not as a replacement for them, and Mr. Cooley would do well to include a set of remedial \\"absolute beginner\\" stretches for the less athletic among us.  Meanwhile, I'm glad I got the book, and I intend to keep doing the stretches.	2005-10-14

Fourteen-year old Lily Owens leaves her home and her abusing father, looking for a safe place for herself and her black nanny, who has insulted three dangerous racists. With nothing more than some clothes, a few dollars, a photo of her late mother, and the mysterious image of a Black Madonna, both of them travel to Tiburon, where Lily expects to find some clues about her mother's life and, perhaps, death. What they find is a bee farm, a pink house and a family full of colorful characters, unforgettable traditions, secrets of its own and very funny hats.<br /><br />This is one of the most moving and wonderful novels I have read in a long time and while I could go on raving about it for pages and days, I would hate to write anything that might be a spoiler.

Koontz takes a turn from his usual, and gives us an unusual twist in the Arctic Circle. I think my question was like the question of some, and I wondered if it would work. Would Dean Koontz try to be Tom Clancy mixed with Oliver North and try to pull of a techno-suspense thriller? No he didn't and I thought WHEW as I finished it up.<br /><br />So we take an assignment to the Arctic, on an iceberg, and let the games begin. But with the climate, storms and what not, trouble brews. As time passes, you wonder if there is somebody there with murder on their mind. You have Harry and Rita Carpenter. Harry is the leader of the expedition, the big dog. Rita has her fears, actually intense phobic reactions. These fears are, #1; Cryophobia: the fear of ice and frost. #2 fear is Frigophobia: the fear of cold. And last but not least is Chionophobia: the fear of snow. Then you have big and bad Pete Johnson, along with Roger Breskin, your basic no fear type guys, Pete is the electric engineer. Then you have Brian Dougherty, related to a former President. I myself couldn't help but laugh at George Lin, who thinks the communists are trying to control them. Claude Jobert, who is also part of the team, and Franz Fischer, who used to date Rita. There you have a believable story, mixed in with the fact that you have a murderer. Oh and by the way, you have bombs in the ice that will blow up the iceberg in about 12 hours. No sweat, right? And HEY!! the Russians are coming to the rescue this time! Don't miss out. I really like the Russian submarine captain, Nikita Gorov, who is in all reality, doing this for his son.<br /><br />I guess the reason I gave this only 4 stars is easy for me. I missed the heart stopping suspense that he normally delivers, and I didn't get much in this. I did get a well written story, one that you can share with anyone without scaring them too much. Koontz really showed a lot of guts in attempting something new, and he pulled it off.<br /><br />So, there was no quote in the beginning from \\"The Book of Counted Sorrows\\" as usual. There was no real blood and guts, as you suspect from Koontz, but he made it work, and did better than most I might add. Now, in his author's note, he added that he previously released this as \\"Prison of Ice\\" by David Axton, and it was rougher and grittier in form. He even said it wasn't his intent to be as technically detailed as Tom Clancy, and I'm glad he wasn't. That would be too overwhelming. But instead, he gives us some frostbite, just a little on the brain to play with our heads here and there.

In five well-balanced chapters, the author opens up the important question about the extent to which the prophet Isaiah-and thus the book that bears his name-was influenced by the strain of Israelite reflection that scholars call 'wisdom'. In setting forth his apology and objectives, Whedbee recognizes the danger of explaining the prophets systematically based upon a narrow selection of texts. For some time, scholars drove a deep wedge between the 'prophet's word' and the 'sage's counsel'.<br /><br />A number of changes in the prevailing scholarly winds have made a study like Whedbee's possible. The sage is now viewed more positively as a guardian of communal integrity than was the case in a previous generation. Also the complex-rather than simple-relationship between traditional wisdom and the prophetic task has become more evident. Whedbee proposes to sort out traditional versus technical wisdom as it appears in Isaiah, presuming that the latter emerges out of the former. Also, he anticipates showing his reader how Isaiah processes and adapts wisdom traditions as he inherits and employs them.<br /><br />Having sketched out a refreshingly loose-fitting-not to say baggy-profile for wisdom and its origins, forms, and intentionalities, Whedbee approaches the formal matter of 'Parables, Proverbs, and Related Gattungen' in an extensive chapter two (pp. 23-79). Methodologically, he cautions against assuming the presence of wisdom influence on Isaiah wherever there is overlap with wisdom terminology. Rather, he seeks distinctive (parabolic) content for the basis of his study. Whedbee is attentive to the 'heterogonous' nature of Isaiah's argumentation, a perspective that allows him to evade the analytical trap of absolutizing genres and then dissecting speeches in order to assign each element to a distinct classification. Isaiah, Whedbee says, is 'free' to use a large number of figures of speech, some of which take a sapiential tack, because the disjunction between prophetic word and creation's witness is a modern rather than an ancient one. For the prophet, the two would have enjoyed an essential unity.<br /><br />In his third chapter ('Woe Oracles and Wisdom', pp. 80-110), Whedbee argues for a close relationship between the Hebrew Bible's 'woe' oracles and the 'ashrey' ('blessed is ...') statements. He approves Gerstenberger's discernment of a strong concern for social justice in both kinds of affirmations, provisionally accepting as well Gerstenberger's theory that the statements derive from popular wisdom settings. After surveying some of the distinctly Isaianic 'woes', Whedbee concludes that both law and wisdom emerge from a common source and thus it is not wise to distinguish too sharply between their respective influence as traditionary sources for Isaiah. Nevertheless, it would be equally unwise to overlook the instructional/sapiential nature of Isaiah's utilization of the tradition.<br /><br />In 'Counsel/Counsellor and Jerusalem Court Wisdom' (ch. four, pp. 111-148), Whedbee argues for a non-secular (in the technical sense) view of professional wisdom circles in biblical Israel and Judah. That is, these circles had their own view of the divine source of counsel and wisdom and their own tradition regarding the inherent limitations of human wisdom. Isaiah's criticism of the sages of his day used their own language ('etsah) and was not uniquely prophetic. Though he criticizes the counsellors of his day, his vision for the future includes wise counsellors, indeed a messianic figure that is cast in part in the figure of just such a counsellor. In contrast to the policies supported by the court counsellors of his day-some of which Isaiah found inimical to Yahwistic faith-the prophet rests in the divine 'counsel' which is not only inscrutable but also trustworthy in its intentions for Israel/Judah.<br /><br />A conclusion (pp. 149-153) neatly restates the outline of an argument that is both cogent and well-presented in the core ofthe book. In the thirty-four years since its publication, Whedbee's work has been criticized but in general has stood its ground admirably. Scholarship regarding the interplay between wisdom, prophecy, and law has been marked by this important work, which now finds itself somewhat in the main stream.e its publication, Whedbee's work has been criticized but in general has stood its ground admirably.

Although I concur with some of the criticism from some of my fellow reviewers below, and would not claim that its merit lay in either great writing or a fascinating plot, I found it reasonably balanced, thoughtful and stirring. The tale of modern day Afghanistan is not a pretty one, but it is one we need to hear. It is especially poignant when you consider the shift that has taken place there in so short a space of time. Hosseini deals with this aspect of his story effectively. In fact, I could translate the image of Afghanistan's awful political situation to the world stage: we are probably closer to our own Afghanization than we might like to think. <br /> <br />However, the true reason for liking the book, for enjoying it with hardly a hitch all the way through, is for its characterization. The main characters are all highly stereotyped - Assef the bully, Baba the heroic male, Amir the coward - except for Hassan. Hassan is a very fine portrait of what I might call \\"a beautiful soul.\\" This is very hard to achieve - a portrait of a character who is somehow reaching out from within, attempting whether consciously or unconsciously, to touch those around him and be at peace with the world, just as he finds it. If my hunch is right, Hosseini deliberately made the other characters stereotypical in order to highlight this one character. I think he has succeeded and it is very fine writing. There are also other levels working along with the more obvious main story. Who and what is the kite-runner? Is he not an evolving character with his own personality which develops throughout the book. What was Baba's point in going against established thinking and befriending an Hazara family, and \\"pissing on the beards\\" of the mullahs and so on? What was the point of describing Soroya's incursion into pre-marital sex? All of these and many other details seem to combine so that we are always, like the main character in the book, being forced to askquestions. And as in all good writing, the questions we have to answer are not about the book, but about ourselves.	2005-10-14

I don't recall ever reading the development of psychosis in a character being accomplished so clearly, so chillingly realistically.<br /><br />This may be King's most symbolic, significant novel.<br /><br />Throughout the book I wondered, is this what it would feel like to be a famous author, a creative soul trapped by the tastes of fans?  One of the worst spiritual imprisonments would be to become known, loved, and sought after for a certain quality in a product, then be held hostage to that quality, to be compelled to continue to recreate, regurgitate that quality forever and forever with no hope for an amen, with no hope to ever take a tangent or get a new lease on writing.<br /><br />\\"I'm your Number One Fan.\\"  Each time Annie Wilkes said this, my hair would have stood on end if it weren't so thin, limp, and lacking, if I hadn't already pulled it all out in the first couple chapters of the book.<br /><br />If anyone understands the very essence of misery, it's Stephen King.  If anyone can impart the ultimate in that feeling in a novel, it's King.  Man, oh man, he did it.  Her put misery on the bookshelves for keeps.<br /><br />I'll bet he thanks God 24/7 that he didn't EVER write a Romance novel!  Or did he, somewhere in his deep, dark past?  Ashes to Ashes!<br /><br />Speaking of a man who writes love stories being held accountable by fans who've come to seek a certain type of plot from him, is that what's happening to Nicholas Sparks and his novel TRUE BELIEVER?<br /><br />The symbolism noted above seems to be prophetically in play.<br /><br />Has MISERY manifested?<br /><br />Is King a prophet as well as a master storyteller and major figure in the literary world?  Well, yes, most of his readers know he is.<br /><br />Some of Nicholas Sparks's fans seem to be compelled by genuine disappointment to leach the appeal out of his latest hardback, mostly feeling a lack of anticipated depth and intensity since TB didn't make them cry, as Sparks's other books have religiously done.<br /><br />I had been dragging feet about picking up TRUE BELIEVER as my first novel in Sparks's collection of romances.  The nearly daily repetition of comments about how disappointing the book was had made me believe it was not worth reading.  A few honest raves, though, kept the pilot lit for my desire to read TRUE BELIEVER (see my review) and draw my own conclusions.<br /><br />Maybe the ending to this story will be that Sparks agrees with Donald Trump's belief that any publicity helps his cause, even bad publicity.  Likely the regular rips of TRUE BELIEVER, balanced with the raves, will increase Sparks's sales, and he'll continue writing with new leases on  themes as his evolving talent demands.<br /><br />I have a question, though.  Why is criticism so mesmerizing that I swallow it whole, yet praise always feels too sweet to be real?  Is there something in that dichotomy which explains why horror usually feels honest and somehow true, while romance sometimes feels like a renewing wellspring of wishful thinking?<br /><br />Maybe we're dust to dust, with life and a few book preferences separating the entry/exit sandstorm.<br /><br />With Admiration For Craft and Shivers Forever,<br />Linda G.

When sports figures write books on leadership, they often take the easy route - athletic metaphors, game time war stories, tenuous applications of sports experiences to business. This refreshing book breaks through such superficial ideas as decisively as a dunk by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in his prime. Ten-time national champion UCLA basketball coach John Wooden - generally considered the greatest college basketball coach to ever hold a clipboard - delivers a leadership book that stands alone at center court. Remarkably, none of Wooden's players recall him urging them to win. Instead, he urged them to do their best every moment. Take care of the process, he says, and the result will take care of itself. To Wooden, preparation is pivotal and every detail matters. Despite his almost obsessive focus on getting the little things right, Wooden believes in balance and consistency. He avoids extremes. Wooden's long-time collaborator and co-author Steve Jamison does a wonderful job of portraying, through the coach, a range of qualities, philosophies and characteristics that apply to every field. We strongly recommend this book to managers and executives who want to know how to lead people to victory in every game.	2005-10-14

First, it speaks in generalities to the rise of the Profession of Arms and talks about the development of professional officers. The second major theme is that it dicusses command and control and the execution and management of violence. the thesis is that decision making, technology and professionalism are essential tools that now become part of the overall thought, deliberate strategy planning and development process of the military. Thirdly, it speaks to and explores tactical decisiveness and lastly, it speaks to international law and custom.<br /><br />All in all this is a great book, but dont expect that the conclusions or answers to these themes will always jump out at you. You will need to read with intention to discern these 4 themes, and some others, and how they may or may not apply to your contemporary comparisons of Modern war, that is from roughly WW II to the Gulf War of 90-91 and Post-Modern War, that is, current warfare post 9-11.<br /><br />This two hundred year work of analysis ends where it begins. With the analysis of a decisive battle. The last 8 pages sum up a few of the auhtors conclusions; one that comes to mind is the political-military-business training and role that officers must have in order to perform there military roles effectively.<br /><br />The greatest benefit of this book will be derived when one compares post modern war with the tactical lessons of the battlefield.<br /><br />The academic debate rages, and will continue to rage over whether or not there is such a thing as the decisive battle. You will need to discern for yourself if the principles of war have changed and if the tactical execution of the battle has a direct correlation to the operational, strategic and or political aspects of war.<br /><br />ps. read this book slowly and with intention, there is much to absorb here.<br /><br />Terry Tucker, Prof Military Studies/History<br /><br />Senior Doctrine Developer SANGMP	2005-10-14

With each new edition that has arrived since the game's conception back in 1989, a new set of rules, more stream lined, more focused on fun rather than rule mongering, has arisen. Shadowrun 4th edition is the biggest rule change yet.<br /><br />Vet's to the game who enjoyed the game for it's rule's, not it's gaming world, have voiced their distaste for the game. I myself was very skeptical of these completely new rules. Let me clarify now, this game has indeed evolved, and these new rules are a step in the right direction. Players of games like Vampire: the Masquarde/the Requiem, Werewolf: the Apocalypse/the Forsaken, and other World of Darkness 1.0 and 2.0 games wil find these rules a bit familiar and comforting.<br /><br />Dice tests are no long single skills with the hopeful adding of a combat or specialty dice pool. Instead, tests are made combining attributes and skills into a combined pool, and all tests aim for the same Target Number \\"Hit\\" of 5. Modifiers just add or take away dice now, and the rule of one has been completly reworked.<br /><br />Thus, all vets to the game line will have to learn a whole new set of rules if htey want to stay alive in the shadows, but that's something they should be used to, adaptation.<br /><br />New Gamers will find these new rule sets much easier to approach than the older sets. While it feels like character creation is more complicated (which is something shadowrun has been known for), gameplay is smoother, the game suffers less from the same old \\"specialty classes getting so much alone time while they do their thing and everyone else gets a big break\\". Instead, with augmented realty (a trend most sci fi groups seem to be taking these days in Cyberpunk games and stories), groups find their Matrix has joined them in the real world.<br /><br />The reason this game loses a star is because there is a standard warning of skepticism. Vets should be warned of the issues with the changed rules. If you loved the rules system and not the game, this isn't an edition you want to pick up. If you want to adapt, and learn a more stream lined system, pick this book up, or go buy the PDF eBook and debate if it's worth your money to buy the physical book follow up.icism.

If this isn't horrifying enough, she finds out she is pregnant. Claire and her husband, Dan, have two children, a daughter, Katie, twelve, and a son, Spencer, seven. Both children came to the marriage after many miscarriages. That Claire would become pregnant after rape is against all odds. If there is such a thing as a blessing in a situation like this, the fact Claire can't remember the assault is a gift from God.<br /><br />This novel delves into the inner feelings of each of the family members as they decide what to do with the baby. Katie is old enough to understand how the baby came to be, but she doesn't want her parents to give it up. Spencer is too young to realize anything except his mom's belly is growing. Dan decides he can't love this child and because of this, Claire agrees to put the child up for adoption. The word goes out and a childless missionary couple is picked to adopt the baby, now known to be a girl.<br /><br />They come to meet the Holland family. Mixed feelings tear Claire apart. She loves her baby, but she doesn't want her raised in a home without a father who truly loves her. Katie can't understand why they can't keep the baby. But, bravely, she hands the little girl over to Rosemary and Ed the day the baby and Claire are released from the hospital. Years go by. The Holland family doesn't speak of the baby named Lara. They move to another town where Dan, a veterinarian, sinks his teeth into a new practice. Claire opens a bookstore. Katie and Spencer grow up, do all the things kids do, but Claire never forgets her daughter. She prays for her constantly. Unbeknownst to Claire, Katie, now called Kate and married with children of her own, wonders what has become of her sister. One day, while Claire is away at a business conference, a letter comes from Rosemary. Kate doesn't trust her mother to share it with her, so she opens it. Rosemary is dying of cancer. She wants the Holland family to raise Lara, now sixteen.<br /><br />This book is a study in human emotions I found hard to put down.

As someone completely new to aviation, there is so much jargon and unfamiliar equipment and so many acronyms and that the potential for looking stupid seems high. I didn't know what a pitot tube is, and I appreciate the fact that Rod Machado doesn't assume that the reader knows that or even that they know how to pronounce it. He says, \\"that' pee-toe, not pilot\\" which is helpful. If you've hung around airports for the past ten years, you probably already knew how to pronounce it, but I didn't. This excellent attention to detail is this books strength. The author gives not one, but two photographs of pitot tube and explains that they are usually found under the left wing. As another example, I had read elsewhere that you need to test your fuel for water, but a single glance at the two photographs he included turned the concept from some vague ethereal haze in the back of my mind to a simple, \\"Okay. I get it.\\" You can see this here on Amazon by clicking the \\"Look inside this book\\" link under the photograph of the book, then go forward a couple of pages to page A3. Figure 7 at the bottom of the page has the caption: \\"Under the wing is a fuel tank sump drain. Since airplane engines don't seem to run very well on impurities, the sumps should be drained before every flight and after every fueling.\\" Figure 8 next to it shows someone checking for impurities witha clear plastic fuel strainer. Nothing beats seeing it. <br /> <br />What I don't like about this book (and the reason I only gave it four stars) are the dumb jokes. When I read about the silly humor in another review I thought, \\"Lighten up, how bad can it really be?\\" Bad. Worse than you think. In fact, I think it detracts from an otherwise excellent book. What exactly does the author mean in the example above when he says, \\"Since airplane engines don't seem to run very well on impurities...\\"? Apparently, it's a joke (yuk, yuk). Besides from being distracting, it seems like what we get is a joke instead of information: what kind of impurities are we talking about here? Water? Or something else? These jokes are peppered throughout the text and they very quickly become tedious. I wish they were in the margin or in a different font so that I could ignore them. On page A5 the author talks about strobe lights on planes. One sentence starts, \\"This is necessary because...\\" I thought to myself, this must be an important point I'd better remember it. Disappointingly, the sentence ends with \\"...because screaming out the window does not work.\\" If these silly jokes were in a special font I could have more easily skipped over them and they would have been less irritating. <br /> <br />This is a large (as big as a medium size phone book), thorough and very well illustrated book and I'm glad I bought it.	2005-10-14

Karen Hancock's writing is smooth and nearly effortless in this second release after her debut novel, Arena--and it's even better on a second read.

Many people think of a Sports Journalism class as an easy A or a blowoff class and this book helps dispel those notions right off the bat.  Former textbooks we've used were almost cartoonish and went along with the aforementioned perceptions.   <br /> <br />In Sports Media, Schultz makes it a point to educate without fluff.  Absent from this book are long biographies about famous sports broadcasters that can be found on the Internet, and it it's place is dedication to the Internet itself as a sports medium.   <br /> <br />The first chapters discuss Reporting and the difference in how to do it between Print and Broadcast as well as the Internet.  Then the book goes into the Visualizaton of sports.  Most anchors that start out in small markets will be shooting their own stories as well as editing them and the book discusses techniques and includes a CD-ROM.   <br /> <br />Other important topics covered that other texts have not are the Ethics of reporting, the Economics and how to work with Media Relations.   <br /> <br />The final chapter could be the most important as it discusses how to get a job.  This is the goal for college students and the text provides excellent advice.   <br /> <br />I recommend the book for Professors as well as anyone who wants a  better knowledge in not just sports broadcasting, but all parts of sports media.	2005-10-14

However, I counted at least three errors in the book.  Early in the book President Theodore Roosevelt is listed as being from the Harvard Class of 1880.  Several pages later he's listed as the class of 1895.  (1880 is the correct date...)  In discussions of Frank Hinkey, he is mentioned as one of only 5 four-time All Americans.  In the photo section, his picture is accompanied by a description that says he is one of 11 four-time All Americans.  Then, there is discussion of Ivy League football dropping from Division I-A to I-AA.  At first this is mentioned as having happened in 1982.  Later in the book, the 1974 Yale team is noted to have the best defense in Division I-AA.  (But they were still in Division I-A in '74, weren't they?)  <br /> <br />Anyway, these were three glaring errors that I picked up without doing any research or fact-checking.  It just makes me wonder how many other errors are in the book that I didn't notice?	2005-10-14

It's an `I can't put it down' book. It makes you wonder how you ever managed to work with traumatized clients without it. It makes you realise why you weren't getting anywhere, why what you were doing in therapy wasn't good enough to help clients move on from their past trauma. <br /> <br />Traditionally therapy with this group of clients focussed heavily on the trauma. This book takes the reader beyond that. For once a book is looking at more than just the trauma in the past as something to be dealt with. It shows the reader why difficulties today must be tackled in a different way when the client has a trauma history than with other clients. But it opens your eyes to ways to work with other clients too. <br /> <br />When I am asked to recommend a book for therapists with trauma clients this is the one I choose. It is the only book that helps one understand why everyday life is so difficult for such clients, something no other book does in such depth or in such a useful way. Reading this book is like waking up to what life is really like for this group of clients; you will never see a client in the same way again. Now you will know why they behave as they do, why making changes is so difficult and why what works with other client groups doesn't work so well when the client comes from an abusive or neglectful family. <br /> <br />Steve Gold shows clearly how incidents of abuse are set within a family context that does not provide the tools for dealing with everyday life in an effective manner. Because of the general family context in which ongoing abuse occurs, these clients have always lacked vital coping mechanisms and abilities that are usually learned during an adequate childhood. The model proposed gives one a framework to work effectively and help the client face both the fears of the past and the fears of today. It places the trauma processing within a therapy that enables the client to grow rather than staying focussed on trauma alone. It provides the reader with a model to use to effectively understand, assess and teach the vital abilities that were never taught in childhood. It opens your eyes to the context in which these clients developed all their strategies to cope, ones that do not help them now.   <br /> <br />This is a book that mustn't be missed. It is one you will take off the shelf again and again. Whatever DSM category your client fits into, if they have problems that arose from a traumatic childhood this is the book to guide you. It is the most important book you will ever buy. <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

I could think of one obvious place the antimatter might have been stowed. I turned to my other half and said, \\"Mark my words. The antimatter will be found (insert spoilers here).\\"  <br /> <br />And, of course, it was. And so I got rather sick of Robert Langdon missing the obvious hiding place and instead blundering around Rome, wasting precious time, and narrowly failing to rescue various Church luminaries. I wanted to smack him--none of the cardinals need have died if Langdon had been able to figure out the SECRET HIDING PLACE that I figured out at once.  And I'm not a Harvard professor. <br /> <br />Add to that Langdon's completely implausible escape from certain death, which was the sort of thing that only works in the movies. I'd love to see Myth Busters poke holes in that scene. Langdon would have been toast. <br /> <br />I'll leave it to others to point out holes in Brown's art history; it's been a long time since I took art history and I'll admit I'm rusty.  As for me, I'll just say that the plot managed to be both over-the-top and dull at the same time. Also, don't you just *love* Dan Brown's \\"strong\\" female characters who seem to do very little other than wear skimpy clothing, get kidnapped, get rescued, and fulfill the hero's yoga-goddess fantasies? <br /> <br />Ugh.	2005-10-14

Todd Boden's evil is nurtured...whether it is by the Nazi he extorts into revealing his secrets, or by himself is worth debating.  The story is a study of abject evil and how it manifests in our world.<br /><br />This is a great book.  Stephen King is a fabulous writer who can really tell a story, and this is a good story to tell.  It's dark but (unfortunately) not supernatural at all.  It's not particulary gory but very scary.  Most of us know that the scariest stories are the ones that are plausible.  Unfortunately, this story is not only plausible but unfolding today in our society.  In that regard King is prescient since this book was written before modern schoolyard massacres.	2005-10-14

What western history expert Robert K.

It contains entries on foodstuffs very rarely seen on modern tables, like chilled meat jellies. <br /> <br />I find the occasional technique too vague or minimally described. I also find Peterson's tone rather arrogant at times, like when he talks about the \\"right\\" consistency for some sauces that may be properly made in more than one style. <br /> <br />I also think he occasionally underseasons and undersalts, and blindly repeats some mantras that simply aren't true.  He says at one point that unsalted butter is often fresher than salted.  I know that's just a \\"fact\\" that goes without saying to a lot of cooks, but as anyone who's ever worked in a market can tell you, it's ludicrous.  If anything, salted butter is more likely to be fresh because it sells so much quicker than unsalted.  A quick perusal of expiration dates in your grocer's case will verify this.  (It's especially true with European-style butters in specialty shops, even in busy stores.)  And again, I think he undersalts frequently anyhow. <br /> <br />Not a book for the casual cook, and I wouldn't buy it for the main-dish recipes.  This is where you go to learn the classic techniques (most of which you won't use more than a few times a year).  Can be a fun read as much as anything else.	2005-10-14

I read this book after hearing so much positive and negative around this issue.  <br /> <br />After reading it, I have found that most of the \\"negative\\" reviews of the fair tax, and the book,  have NO relationship to the Plan or to the book. It seems that there are politics going on in how some people, including some of the reviewers, interpret the \\"fair tax\\". Instead of reviewing the book, they are making political statements that meet their needs often twisting the plan or comparing it to other plans (i.e. VAT) that are false. <br /> <br /> The book specifically addresses the facts and states there is no Plan that is perfect and there is no free lunch.

He made a name for himself as the country was being formed, especially with his defense of \\"the rules of law\\" against the will of the majority. He was one of the last of the old Federalists. He was a foreign minister to Holland, Portugal, and Prussia, and was Secretary of State under Monroe (where he was the main force in establishing the Monroe Doctrine). He became the sixth President in a controversial election that was decided in the House of Representatives.<br /><br />Parson's short (272 pages) but thorough and well-written biography of Adams is a job well done. She details the accomplishments of his life, but focuses primarily on the man himself. Adams was a stern man (his portrait reminds me of some evil Dickens character, Marley perhaps), and not well-liked by the public. He believed that one should not \\"run\\" for a political office, but should just accept it if offered (imagine that today!). He hated Andrew Jackson and slavery, and fought hard against both. This is an excellent book on an interesting man.	2005-10-14

If you don't live near woods, any small patch of nature will do: This writer sings the praises of vacant lots, where beetles live under rocks and dandelion tufts wait  to be blown into the wind. Take your child outside and make a necklace of clover flower.  If there's a creek nearby, let him put his foot in. Find blackberries and pick them. If you have woods, encourage a fort.    Oh, brave, new mom am I. A few days this summer, I let my two boys, ages 7 and 9, ride their bikes with neighbor children to a nearby creek. They waded and played and had a picnic. The boogie man didn't get them; a snake didn't get them (though they did see a snake).  We called these days \\"wandering days,\\" quoting a children's book we like.

The allure of this book is two-fold. Your eyes are first greeted with folk art on its finest display. Children and adults alike will be transfixed on the minute details that give every page life.<br /><br />The gentle story of Celestine and her magical geranium is also pure joy. Her flower-friend grows ever larger, bringing joy to all who see it. Eventually the flower fades, as all flowers do. Rather than bringing sadness, the geranium and Celestine gift all those who received joy with seeds, showing that the gifts of others provide joy long after they have faded.<br /><br />My children and their friends were equally enchanted with this beautiful book. Just as Celestine's geranium brought joy to her community, this book will bring joy to all children.	2005-10-14

Not only is this book useful for songwriters but for worship leaders and ministry musicians as well.<br /><br />Baloche and the Owens' navigate the theory and mechanics of song composition without being too lofty for beginners or too condescending for veterans.  Songwriters and worship leaders should get this book for its clinical value alone.<br /><br />Of special interest to writers of worship songs is the authors' perspective that it is more difficult to write a good congregational song than a good artist song-the implication being that most of us assume the opposite.  They call attention to the struggle, and necessary self-denial a songwriter experiences when trying to create truly great melodies with  fresh, imaginative lyrics that can all be readily owned by common, untrained singers.  It was both freeing and compelling to read through their thoughts on that.<br /><br />The book also examines the role that music plays in leading and expressing the emotions, and how valuable that is in completing the worship experience of the Church.  As a worship leader and songwriter I was refreshed and inspired by the authors' plea on behalf of the Church, \\"Please, help us feel something!\\"	2005-10-14

Sometimes I buzz through the parts about Swiss bank account transfers and customs-house forms. Other times I drink in all those technical details like a foaming schooner of Flemish ale. Depends on your mood, I guess. Regardless, I always savor the action sequences, which are relayed in splendid detail, and Forsyth's unique brand of gallows humor.     This is about how one man sets up and carries out a coup d'etat, dollar by dollar, bullet by bullet. It it not just a shoot-em-up, and those who wish to read such a book should go elsewhere. But for those who savor the details, and camaraderie shared among wild geese in an Ostend bar at the end of a good day's scheming and plotting, this book is one in a million.	2005-10-14

We can see in your book how his days and nights in the cottage helped Lincoln to  hold on to and expand what he had until victory in the 1864 election was assured. <br /> <br />The other is the loving relationship of the President with his wife, Mary Lincoln. We often hear of her oddities and running up of debts. What we do not hear of, and what admirably is stressed in your book, is what you describe as \\"the mutual affection and mutual dependence\\" that always linked them despite their great differences in character.  Respect for Mary Lincoln, and her contributions to the greatness of Abraham Lincoln, is something we could use more of in writing American history. <br /> <br />I will not go on expect to say that I think I have already indicated the greatness of your book, and my hope that librarians and readers everywhere will have an opportunity to benefit from its revelations and the new light it brings on the life of one of our very greatest Presidents. <br />	2005-10-14

His wife Beth is a marathon athlete who likes hot showers and a warm bed every night, so backpack trips are not on her \\"things I want to do\\" list.<br /><br />This all changed with the unexpected suicide of Beth's brother due to undiagnosed depression. Jeff had a background of hiking for a cause, and in times of personal crisis his instinct was to head for the trail. He proposed to Beth that he hike the John Muir Trail as a way of raising depression awareness, with Beth being his off-trail support team.  Instead, Beth decided to join the hike with him.<br />[...]<br />With chapter six the journal stories begin - not a day by day journal, but more a chronicle of the highlights and mishaps that all backpackers encounter. Bears, things left behind, lightning, trail lessons learned that only the high Sierras can teach you. I tense up reading that they are going over the mountain passes in the afternoon - prime thunderstorm time. If you are a hiker looking for an armchair read, or someone who has done or is thinking about doing this trail, you will enjoy this book.<br /><br /> Though Jeff is the author, the last chapter is by Beth, and there is an appendix on depression. As a hiker, I enjoyed reading this book of someone else's experiences. As someone who has had a few episodes of depression, this book has make me pay more attention to friends who are having low points.	2005-10-14

When writing a novel based on a Bible character, I think it should be as accurate as possible.  Yet Mr. Morris circumvents the topic that Abraham and Sarah are half-brother and sister (as stated by Abraham in Genesis 20:12-13 when justifying himself to King Abimelech).  Instead, Abraham & Sarah have supposedly never met before their engagement in \\"No Woman So Fair\\".  Unlikely.  Also, Abraham gives a cheesy answer to the Pharaoh of Egypt as to why he stated Sarah was his sister and not his wife.  In the Bible, Abraham does not answer the Pharoah, but later addresses this question when answering King Abimelech (Genesis 20:11).  Christian historical and bibliographical fiction using Bible characters should be built upon what is already known, not override the truth.	2005-10-14

During what was an overall positive review, he managed to write one line that perfectly summed up the book.    \\"This is a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\"    That one line says it all. Lucas got it. Just like the author got it. Mr. Sanchez may be just a \\"fan\\" to some, but this \\"fan\\" managed to do for Van Halen what no one else, be it fan or professional, has ever done for the band in their entire history. It's about time. Mr. Sanchez put together a fun, interesting, accurate book with a beautiful tribute to Eddie Van Halen. And since the band has never written their own story, and at this point likely never will, this will be as good as it gets.    Up until this point, the only written material we'd received from Van Halen \\"fans\\" never made the passing grade. I've been a VH fan since the band debuted and I own everything ever written about them. Back in the nineties there was even some VH fanzine called \\"The Inside.\\" It was by some fan and his buddies. Other than the fact it had really nice pics, it was a typical fanzine written by what appeared to be some college guys with one too many VH posters on their wall. Not exactly a bastion of journalism or something people will seek out years from now. At best, a minor blip on the radar screen.     Then there was the Van Halen Encyclopedia, a collaborative effort by hundreds of fans. It was a fine effort, but this too fell short. It's really just a journal of VH info listed alphabetically. Not the most exciting read. More the cure for insomnia.    Van Halen 101 got it right and goes light years beyond anything that has ever been written on the band. As Lucas said, \\"a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\" This ain't Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt.\\" And really, who would want to waste their money on a bunch of fiction dressed up nicely by Neil Strauss? Unlike \\"The Dirt,\\" Van Halen 101 is legit and positive andfocuses on what is truly important. No time to waste here with \\"inside scoops.\\" Fans who sit around drooling and waiting for that type of stuff need to get a life. Mr. Sanchez shows integrity by not relying on that type of material.     With Van Halen 101, what you see is what you get. No where on this book does the word \\"biography\\" appear. Ever. Not once. It has never been marketed or labeled as such. While it does contain plenty of biographical information on the band, the book is presented as a \\"comprehensive guide to the amazing history, music, impact and influence of the Mighty VH.\\" It says so, clear as day, on the back cover of Van Halen 101. So the author and publisher have never presented this as a \\"biography\\", nor have they ever claimed to have \\"inside scoops\\" or anything of that sort. It's clearly stated the book is a comprehensive guide.    One of the best and easiest ways to determine a book's worth and status is to compare it to other books about the same subject. Just compare Van Halen 101 with the other VH book released in 2005, Backbeat Books \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music.\\" Talk about night and day, Van Halen 101 demolishes that book. Absolutely crushed it. The funny thing is that \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music\\" was written by a \\"professional\\" writer named Malcolm Dome. Yes, Malcolm is a music journalist who also wrote another Van Halen book called \\"Excess in All Areas\\" back in the nineties. By the way, \\"Excess in All Areas\\" is awful, too.    Meanwhile, Van Halen 101 was written and entirely put together by a \\"fan.\\" Well, this \\"fan\\" knows more about VH than a thousand Malcolm Domes, that's for sure.     Van Halen 101 is well worth the money. There is simply nothing out there in book form about Van Halen that comes anywhere close to it. Until the band members get off their duffs and put something together, this is THE Van Halen book.	2005-10-14

The reason being that when I'm left to my own musings I'm just not a linier thinker. It's not that I go in all different directions. It's that the road to my destination goes serpentine. I'm distracted with thoughts that apply on the fringe and so I'd certainly want to stop and describe where my brain is meandering. That's exactly what Klosterman does here. <br />I do not have author Klosterman's excuse for such mental behavior as I am not a recreational drug user. If this writing technique of ours is actually one that readers appreciate then I should be grateful to my mother for allowing me to skip the inevitable depression that comes of drug and alcohol abuse (and in giving me a timely advantage) by dropping me on my head as a child. I don't actually remember being dropped on my head, but given the unexplained upper forehead scar, my non-drug addled brain, and yet having a Klosterman-esque propensity to mentally wander, I expect she did. <br />Now I must add a, \\"buyer beware!\\" One would normally expect that if an author takes a roundabout course to get where he's going, and if he has a lot to say about his actual topic, then you're going to have a fairly lengthy read. This book is a tiny read. It follows then that Klosterman doesn't end up writing very many pages on topic; that is if his topic is suppose to be dead rock stars.  <br />I bought the book because I wanted to read about dead rock stars and I wanted to be entertained by Klosterman's wit. What we get is a little of both. <br />	2005-10-14

Having said that, I am glad that I did not allow so-so reviews of this book to stop me from purchasing it.  My interest is in day trading e-mini futures.  Other books I have read relating to Elliott wave have only provided minimal general guidance.  This is the only book on Elliott wave that I have found invaluable.  It took a few readings and some practice but, low and behold, I can now (often) scrutinize a wave and determine if it is an impulse wave or a correction.  The beauty of this is that it allows you to know if you are still in a correction or if the trend has resumed.  It allows you to know if there has been a 5th wave failure or if some form of correction is still developing.  At the end of a 5th wave when the market is spiking up and down I can eventually tell if a new thrust in the direction of the trend is part of the trend and possibly the end of the 5th wave or whether it is just a part of a diagonal triangle.  I have a long way to go in mastering it but I can often see the C wave patterns and appreciate what is going on.  All in all, the market makes more sense to me now.  One reviewer commented that doing this would not be possible on intraday charts.  I would have to disagree.  Even small C waves can take 30 minutes to hours to develop.  Once the market has made enough of a move to recognize the correction you would only need a couple of minutes to figure it out even if you consulted the book.  So, in short, I am impressed and consider this the best book on trading I have ever read.	2005-10-14

I saw the movie first, and I would have to say the book is much better. I've read it about six times because it's just such a good book. The book contains so much detail that you actually feel like you're there with the characters. You can picture Noah, the protagonist, as he grows older. You see Allie with her curls and bright smile walk up to Noah in the first scene. She's shy and girly, and Noah is bold and brave. The two share an amazing life together, but only after many dramatic years apart. The Notebook, written by Nicholas Sparks, is one of my favorite books for many reasons. It's a romantic drama and makes you feel warm inside. When the characters laugh, you laugh. When the characters cry, you cry. You feel their pain and their happiness. Sparks is an amazing writer because of all these things. I'm sure there are many interpretations of the theme of this book, but the theme that stuck out most to me would be, what's meant to be will always find its way. This may sound a little clich, but that's exactly how the book makes me feel. After reading this book I guess you could say it gives you hope and faith that everything will work out for the best. Nicholas Sparks writes a compelling introduction and after the first chapter you can't put the book down. If you liked the movie, I would defiantly recommend reading the book.	2005-10-14

TaRessa's debut novel, Hot Spot, is an entertaining and scandalous read to be slowly enjoyed on a cool, autumn day.  Kendra Harrell is highly educated, professionally focused, and looking for the love of her life.  To keep her grounded and add a little spice to her life are Kendra's good friends:  Meghan Bennett and Stephanie Ivey.  When a business deal goes sour and a new opportunity knocks, but it requires jaunting to the Caribbean's, Kendra's girls are there to cheer her on, encourage, support and quickly pack their bags so that they can join her  and get their tan on.  But, they also bring their mainland baggage with them and must slay demons while trying to have a good time and keep up a good face.  What Kendra does not plan for is one of her clients stalking her and following her to her destination.  This client isn't just any client, she is a client with a secret and she needs Kendra's public relations expertise and 'spin doctor' approach to help her out of her dilemma.  And my oh my what a dilemma it is--totally unexpected and unpredicatable!<br /><br />From the witty to the wicked, Hot Spot is a charming and steamy read.  Taressa explores \\"the hot spot between romantic and professional success, and the things we do when they conflict with one another.\\"  (I bet you thought she was talking about another type of hot spot and not to be disappointed she does mention it.) The characters held my attention and in the process, made me laugh, fuss, angry, and laugh some more. The  pacing wasn't as smooth as I would have liked and the plot stalled in the middle but the unexpected twists and turns were enough to keep me reading until the end. There was one twist that was so original, I did not anticipate it or see it coming! Actually it caused me to pause and sit with my mouth wide open for a minute before regrouping and continuing the read.  Although the trio sister friend theme was not original, TaRessa interweaved other topics that held my interest such as the business side of the public relations industry; workplace romance; maintaining one's ethics in a cutthroat workplace competition; and erotic moves that would even surprise the Kama Sutra. Hmmmm! If you are looking for a quick, easy and entertaining read, centered around three female friends, then I recommend you pick up the Hot Spot by TaRessa.

In spite of having a boyfriend, three of her best pals are males: mystery writer Rice Jordan, injured professional football player Franklin \\"Coach\\" Brass, and playboy Geffen Cage.  Still she is concerned that the trio spends their time chasing women then finding the Lord.<br /><br />Sunnie sells the three womanizers a Beverly Hills home on the condition they attend church.  They have no plan to sing God's praise, but agree to Sunnie's stipulation because a few hours a week is a cheap price to play to be able to convert the former brothel into an elite bed and breakfast and gala event hosting facility.<br /><br />However, Sunnie, who has a knack for detecting evil spirits, realizes that the house is filled with malevolence.  Vixx, a nymphomaniac she-devil, abetted by Cr&egrave;p the ghoul, plans to destroy the men.  She especially will use her abilities to morph into their fantasy women.  Only Sunnie stands in her way of capturing the hearts and souls of these non-believing males.<br /><br />When Sunni is not preaching fans will appreciate this gender bending haunted house tale in which evil vs. good battle for the souls of three philandering males.  The story line for the most part is action-packed though the heroine can get long winded when she goes off on one of her sermons.  Still there is plenty of romance between Sunnie and read the book, but the key relationship of this supernatural tale is between the warrior women Sunnie and Vixx with the prizes being three hunks.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

In just the first few pages, they perfectly described my over-eating episodes as if they'd been there with me while I devoured an entire bag of chocolate chips.  And in the subsequent chapters they revealed the lies I've been telling myself in the back of my mind, helping me get honest with myself about my distorted view of my body, my eating, and how to find happiness.  Although the book is clearly aimed at women in their mid-life (one of the 8 points in the plan is specific to menepause), I found most of the book applicable to me as a 30yo man who has fluctuated between over-eating and restricting my whole life.  I feel like, for the first time in my life, a veil has been lifted that has revealed all the ridiculous lies I've been telling myself that keep me unhappy.  I'm just starting out, trying to regain my ability to know when I'm really hungry (not tired, angry, bored, or depressed), and when I'm full (rather than eating until I'm sick).  I already find I'm eating more than I convinced myself I should eat (though surely less than I was eating, since I'm not gorging on cookies anymore).  I also have more energy and find myself able to deal with work and home with a smile, rather than succumbing to tension.  If you've ever told yourself that your happiness is dependant on losing a few more pounds, or you've ever started eating a cake by taking a small slice, then rationalized another small slice, then another, and another and another, until the cake is nearly gone -- this book will be a kind, gentle wake-up call and help you take rational steps toward a healthy relationship with food.	2005-10-14

At a nearby restaurant, Sam introduces Guy to Nadya Kassam who opens up her attach&eacute; case to allegedly show him something.  Instead she is a suicide bomber killing herself and Sam and hospitalizing a severely injured Guy.<br /><br />After Guy heals, his boss Freddie Lewis sends him to Saudi Arabia to ostensibly work a claim.  He meets Musa Salech who takes Guy around town.  However, the visiting American also witnesses a homicide in which the police name him as the prime suspect.  As he fears for his life from criminals, terrorists, and the cops, Guy with Musa's help tries to prove his innocence but obvious allies like the Webbing-Turner company of England sell him out to the authorities while Dr. Kamilia Rutger, Nadya's step-sister, joins his side and wants to know why.  Adding to Guy's fears is that he learns back home his beloved wife Diane and their ten years old daughter is threatened.<br /><br />This is an interesting look at the business-terrorist complex from the perspective of a potential victim.  The lead character is the last Guy anyone would believe turns into a  hero as he luckily escapes death in Boston and Saudi Arabia, but becomes a champion when his beloved females are threatened.  Fans of suspenseful character driven thrillers will enjoy his efforts to extricate himself from trouble and keep his family safe while also wondering like Kamilia what drove her step-sister.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

I tried to look inside this book, but such info is not available here at this moment. At least I know the former edition was really good. Everything else than 2 way ANOVA was explained in narrative ways that definitively help to understand this topics much better than so many other book filled of junk equations. However, I'm not so sure if you should use this book if you're currently taking a statistic related course because you may need immediate answers, just equations and repetitive solutions. The proper and deeper knowledge that will be useful in real life when doing research takes much longer time to learn and you shold take it at some time later on.

When I go to bed at night I feel much more settled knowing that I am organized and prepared not just for the next day or week, but for the whole semester.

To this extent, their writing style lacks any useful analogies whatsoever which might bridge the gap between the known and the unknown. <br /> <br />The book is full of droll and distracting fantasy references which are completely irrelevant to the subject matter, and are prone to taking the unsuspecting reader off task. <br /> <br />The potential purchaser should also be forewarned that the authors tend towards another immature trait of attempting to impress the reader with their linguistic abilities. Yet, to be effective at teaching they should have remembered to never use a complicated word where a simple one will do. <br /> <br />Many examples are rambling and inconcise, where step-by-step quickly degrades into an ambiguous and vague path. <br /> <br />Not every developer can obtain DOMAIN Authority in order to issue SSL certificates and it's too bad that the authors don't allow for this type of scenario, especially when a reporting system is on a VPN. <br /> <br />All of the content is there, but it's up to the reader to filter and translate most of it from the pitfalls aforementioned into something more to the center of the bell curve. <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

You'll need some reading stamina, because it's long and parts of it are uninteresting.  Hall's facts are wrong in a couple of places (just a few examples: his chapter on Islam is pretty much worthless, and since when was Thor's hammer made of ram's horns?) and he seems to have an axe to grind, in terms of linking Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism to Pythagoreanism, Alchemy, etc etc to the shadowy Illuminati pulling the strings behind the formation of the United States and its model of government.  America supposedly has some sort of Mystical Destiny that was predetermined by a group of Immortal Magi, the true initiates of the Elysian and Hermetic mysteries, and so on.  Please .. tone down the crazy just a bit, Mr. Hall! <br />You'll have to read with a slightly critical eye to pick out which parts of this book are useful to you and which parts are not, but overall it is definitely worth the effort.  I was introduced to a lot of new ideas.  One of the benefits of mysticism is the new perspective it can give you, a new way of perceiving the same old things you've been looking at all your life.  There are profound secrets everywhere which will reveal themselves to the one who makes the EFFORT to discover them. <br />As far as this book being \\"evil,\\" it just plain isn't.  It may pose a challenge to the dogmatic status-quo of the current dominant religion (which incidentally, is failing to meet the needs of modern civilization) ... but that religion itself was regarded as a threatening evil 2000 years ago when it encroached on the very Mysteries which Hall elucidates in this book.  The only \\"evil\\" being perpetrated is by those who would - for their own selfish reasons - keep humanity in spiritual darkness.  So there.	2005-10-14

This book categorically and metaphorically allies you with the absolute fundamentals for positioning your establishment for success.  So, in keeping with one of the teachings of this book on building suspense, I will just say that there is an era immediately following this 'experience' economy that is delineated with much delight at the conclusion of the book.	2005-10-14

G Bissenger uses a unique type of writing. Most sports writers that I have read have a single character that they follow through the entire novel. In this novel, Bissenger, scopes the entire team. Through this, we experience the feeling of the team, and the bonds between the players. Much of the book is written about the conflicts on the field. More often than not, these conflicts relate somehow on the field and off. Some of the conflicts are interrelated between football and their personal life, but also to life in general. If this book is read for strictly entertainment, it is an excellent book, but on the next level, it is even more intense. <br /> The intensity level of the book almost makes you feel like you are in school. I, being in school and playing football, can especially understand these situations. The author plays on many people's dreams and ideas through simple occurrences on the football field. Every football player that isn't first or second string dreams of having their name called in a desperate situation. This is made evident after Booby gets hurt, and the third string player is called upon to take his place. Since I have started playing football, all of my coaches have told me that this sport is not just about the Friday nights under the lights, but it also teaches you about life.  <br /> One of the most amazing things about this book is how the author not only watches the team through their struggles on the field, but also in their day-to-day life. Booby Miles is an incredible running back with virtually no education was professionally bound. At the beginning of the season, he was already receiving college letters, but then he tore ligaments in his knee. We see the fear sadness as Booby realizes that he will never get into college, and he sees his dream of playing college and possibly professional ball going down the drain.  <br /> Also, a young fullback, who has trouble with fumbling the ball, receives some of the spotlight. On the field, he has trouble holding on to the ball, and his Permian alumnus father, who is also an alcoholic, gives this young man trouble. At one point, he walks onto the field and publicly criticizes his son, and pushes him. Even worse, at home, he experiences things that would be very difficult for normal writers to get to. This illustrates the difference between this writer, and most other writers.  <br /> After reading this novel, I have a new appreciation for high school athletes and their social lives. Being one, I see that this writer found the real deal. This writer has dug deep into the social and athletic lives of these players. It is amazing that a writer can get into the heads, and bring the reader into the minds of these young men. <br />	2005-10-14

Phillips would most likely turn out to be just another J. Frank Dalton.  But Phillips' story is a little different.  After all, he never claimed to be Butch Cassidy, others simply claimed it for him and then only after he was dead and gone.  So I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />Not only did the author present some rather convincing evidence that Phillips was indeed Robert LeRoy Parker, alias George \\"Butch\\" Cassidy, but the book also turned out to be the most informative book which I have read on the inner workings of a true western outlaw gang.  If one is not convinced that Phillips was Cassidy, one must surely conclude that he was at least a member of Cassidy's \\"Wild Bunch.\\" <br /> <br />The most compelling evidence, in my view, is the following: 1) the opal ring which Phillips sent to Butch Cassidy's Wyoming sweetheart, Mary Boyd, shortly before his death (inscribed on the inside \\"Geo C to Mary B\\"); 2) Phillips' Colt Peacemaker with Butch Cassidy's brand carved in the handle, 3) the affirmative handwriting analysis comparing a letter known to have been written by Butch Cassidy with a later letter written by Phillips; and finally 4) Phillips' intimate knowledge of Butch Cassidy, his associates and the people he knew or worked with, the areas in which he lived and rode, and the robberies which he planned and carried out; all as  expressed in his unpublished [autobiography?] \\"The Bandit Invincible, the Story of Butch Cassidy.\\" <br /> <br />The most interesting thing to me about this book, however, is not whether or not William Phillips was, in fact, Butch Cassidy, it was the detailed descriptions of how Cassidy would plan and carry out his raids. I was also struck by the intimate details concerning the cattle wars in Wyoming and life as it really might have been in the old west.  I only wish that Phillips hadn't used a fictitious name for theSundance Kid in \\"Bandit Invincible\\" which was written in 1930.  If, as he said, he changed the names of living persons so as not to incriminate them, one can only wonder why he changed Harry Longabaugh's name in his book and yet described the manner in which he died.  That is a real puzzler. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about this book was the way in which it skipped back and forth between Phillips' writings and information from the author's other sources, at the same time introducing lots of new people and information.  This seemed to confuse the issue and break the continuity (ergo, 5 to 4 stars).  All things considered, though, this is a truly remarkable story and a must read for anyone interested in the old west and its history. <br />	2005-10-14

Young Christopher relates a chapter in the story of his family's life through the prism of his autistic eyes. Yet this is done without a hint of condescension or scrap of pity by author Mark Haddon.<br /><br />Christopher finds his neighbor Mrs. Shear's standard poodle Wellington  dead in the front yard, impaled by a garden fork. As he sets about \\"detecting\\" the solution to this vicious murder, he finds instead threads of evidence that lead to the revelation of a terrible family secret; one that sends him on a quest he never thought himself capable of conducting.<br /><br />Christopher views things differently than the majority of us, and reduces most situations to mathematical formulae. One is left realizing that there is more than one way to view things, and perhaps Christopher is able to deal with his life better than many of us. His articulation of society's maxims are humorous yet spot on, e.g. \\" People say that you always have to tell the truth. But they do not mean this because you are not allowed to tell old people that they are old and you are not allowed to tell people if they smell funny, or if a grown up has made a fart. And you are not allowed to say `I don't like you' unless that person has been horrible to you.\\"<br /><br />This novel is most certainly a landmark work.  It will be interesting to see if someone ventures to make it into a film; that would be a terrific challenge, but perhaps one that Mr. Haddon is exploring.	2005-10-14

I can't say that the book is worth it for this reason alone, but it does make one contemplate moral theories from a different perspective.<br />2) This book is a comprehensive survey of the status of moral theories.  Williams makes a strong (and largely successful) attempt at presenting the current state of the most important current (as of the writing) moral systems.  There is also a criticism of each different system.  (As the other reviews will tell you, Williams is opposed to the very idea of morality, if not ethics)<br /><br />Now for the negatives.<br />1) Williams consistently misreads or misrepresents the philosophers he is criticising.  This is perhaps the most important fault of the book, as the purpose of the book is a critical evaluation of morality, and that can scarcely be convincing or useful when the opposition is not accurately rpresented.  The most glaring example that comes immediately to mind is his account of Kant's \\"psychological hedonism\\"<br />2)  His writing is simply sub par for any serious work of philosophy.  I spend more time deciphering his sentences and paragraphs than I do with those of Kant, and not because they are dealing with complex and difficult subjects, but because they are meandering and poorly organised.  It is somewhat rare to find a paragraph in which he sticks to the subject at hand.<br />3)  Related to #2 is the lack of argumentation in the book.  Williams often makes sweeping and brazen assertions without one shred of argumentation, especially in his account of human moral psychology in the chapter dealing with Kant and in his conclusion in the last chapter.  Such argumentation is what, ultimately, separates philosophy from mere dogma, and is conspicuously absent in much of Williams' work.<br />4)  The last problem is with his philosophy itself.  He purports to remove morality from ethics, but leaves no account of what ethics is without morality.  The best description that we get in the book of ethics without morality is that it is \\"vague\\" (p. 6) and that ethical considerations are merely one type of practical consideration. (p. 182)  In the final analyss, Williams tells us that we should act how we want to act because some of our desires are more important than ethical considerations, but each agent must decide for himself, without any guidance from anything but teh agent's own dispositions, which of his desires are able to override ethics, or whatever is left of ethics after Williams is done with it.  In fact, what would even count as an ethical consideration is unclear.<br /><br />This book is largely unsatisfying.  Why should I slog through 200 pages of sub-par philosophy to find an ethical account less sophisticated than that of most two year olds?  At least two year olds are clear in their reasoning.  The reason that I even gave this book 3 stars is that it is important to know ones enemy and Williams' perspective on morality, if not ethics, is rather interesting.  Finally, I must say that, as much as I disagree with the other reviewers, one is absolutely correct in recommending \\"Internal and External Reasons.\\"  That paper is everything that this book isn't, as well as being Williams' most important contribution to moral philosophy.  It is also quite crucial in gaining a detailed understanding of Williams' positions in this book.	2005-10-13

Solberg is well qualified to do so as he was on Halsey's staff at the time.  He finds that Halsey's \\"kitchen cabinet\\" staff ignored repeated warnings and requests to guard San Bernadino Strait, the route that Imperial Japanese naval forces would use to attempt to attack the transports in the Leyte Gulf area.  Even Solberg's boss, the Intelligence Officer for the Fleet, had his warnings ignored.  Solberg hypothesizes the reason for Halsey ignoring the warnings as a result of his inner staff and Halsey all being aviators, and all wanting, in Halsey's case desperately wanting, to get the Japanese carriers.  Unfortunately, the Japanese carriers were bait, a spent force, designed to distract Halsey (the Japanese knew he was commanding the American fleet carrier force at that time).  Solberg's boss was a Marine and not an aviator; other warnings came from surface force commanders.  RADM Davidson, commanding one of Halsey's carrier task groups, did try to get a warning through, but there is no evidence Halsey ever saw it; his staff likely insulated him from news he didn't want to hear. <br /> <br />Solberg's book is a case study for decision making under stress and under uncertain conditions.  Although it is a military case, and an old one, the lessons from it apply to civilian public and private sector organizations.

I tried the exercises for headache, neck pain and lower back pain, and after doing all of them, the pain was less for about 30 seconds and then I still had the pain I began with. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that anyone can get instant relief any way at all when having this kind of pain, otherwise the pharmaceutical companies would not be getting the billions of dollars a year that they get. I should think that most people would realize that for exercise to be effective a continual regular exercise program has to be developed under the care of a physical therapist or doctor.  <br /> <br />The only way these exercises may give some relief right away would be for the kind of pain that you get occasionally when you slept wrong, or for the odd kink that mysteriously appeared, and then for only the mildest pain imaginable. But for anyone with any kind of chronic pain, or pain due to years of bad posture or computer use, this title is very MISLEADING! I don't think instant pain relief in these circumstances is possible the way the author says. At least they didn't work for me. <br /> <br />However, the exercises probably would be excellent for longterm use and for prevention of some of these issues, and therein lies the positive aspect of the book. I would recommend getting it at the library first and if you are satisfied, then buy it.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

If you already know that experiences with small children can actively induce abandoment fantasies and inspire drinking games, then welcome to the club.  This is a very funny book.   <br /> <br />Plot-wise, it's Marrit Ingman's experience with a difficult baby (now a gem of a preschooler), post-partum depression, and a marriage that gets understandably shaky.  Theme-wise, it's about her journey out of the darkness and a few words of wisdom for PPD mothers who need to get there.  Seven pages in the back of the book list organizations, internet sites and books for further reference. <br /> <br />I've given the book five stars, but Marrit Ingman so exactly lived the urban activist version of my life (or maybe I lived the suburban intellectual version of hers) that I just don't have much perspective.  Would someone who had a \\"normal\\" mothering experience find Ingman's perspective amusing?  I think so.  The line between normal and nutty can be pretty thin and wavering -- especially for anyone getting only five hours of sleep a night.   <br /> <br /> The work's biggest flaw is the inconsistent tone, which most usually expresses her energetic anger and despair (the rage aria on mall photography studios is priceless) but also, toward the end of the book, her energetic love for her son and enthusiasm for her life, friends, and work.  The occasional more journalistic essays on PPD seem out of place, even though they may have served as the book's raison d'etre.  Perhaps she should have incorporated her personal experiences with the books and organizations in the resources section into the narrative instead.  It might have come off as a product placement, but Ingman doesn't hesitate to use brand names (and therapists' initials) of things that didn't work.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: Funny for most, cathartic for this PPD survivor, and a must for those at risk for PPD.	2005-10-13

It's also a must-read for those seeking the <br />perspective of young men and women who volunteer for the armed <br />forces knowing they will go abroad to fight for the <br />freedom of others.   <br />  <br />If you've read Elisha Hunt Rhodes' Civil War journal, <br />Tom Brokaw's \\"The Greatest Generation\\", or Stephen <br />Ambrose's \\"Citizen Soldiers\\", then you should add this <br />World War I memoir to your collection of perspectives <br />of foot soldiers who lived and breathed war day in <br />and day out.  Grand histories of battles and wars are <br />one thing, but reading such close-in, first-hand <br />accounts helps us to understand how war and death and <br />occupation effect the thousands of \\"little people\\" <br />involved in the process.   <br /> <br />When you read how the book was written (over a decade <br />after the end of the war, using his notes and <br />postcards), you'll appreciate that the level of detail <br />that McQuain remembered was the direct result of what <br />a searing experience the trauma of war was for him.  <br />As is the case with many soldiers years and even <br />decades after the fact, McQuain was able to remember <br />the minutest detail with only a small reminder of the <br />facts.  McQuain's daughter explains the process, and <br />(as Ken Burns did so well in the case of Elisha Hunt <br />Rhodes and others in \\"The Civil War\\" documentary) <br />tells the reader briefly about the rest of her <br />father's life and a bit about the family he raised.   <br /> <br />The view of McQuain's life after the war is the one <br />known all too well by families of veterans.  But too <br />often vets are reluctant to share with their families <br />the horrors they experienced abroad.  \\"To the Front <br />and Back\\" will give the reader a new perspective on <br />that grandfather who wouldn't talk about his <br />experiences in World War I or World War II, or on <br />what's currently being experienced by a son, daughter, <br />husband, or wife who is currently in Iraq or <br />Afghanistan.   <br />	2005-10-13

I was captivated by \\"White Teeth\\"'s sometime caricature-ish portrayal of the culturally and ethnically diverse cast of characters:  some of them take themselves too seriously, some of them don't think much of themselves or of their surroundings, but in the author made even the most self-conscious characters be a little self-deprecating in a humorous way.  Details are thrown at the reader either purposefully and effectively, or in a way that adds more color to the writing.  Upon reading the book, I felt that it's alright to take one's self seriously, and it's alright if one doesn't, but that we should both respect and take some humor in our diversity.  In \\"White Teeth\\" I felt that the author used diversity as a very good tool to make captivate the reader's interest, propel the story along, introduce conflict, and introduce humor all at the same time. <br /> <br />In \\"On Beauty\\", there is still that sprinkling of ethnic and cultural details, strong and minute, but they are more often neither necessary nor effective.  It seems that taking all the ethnic, gender, and cultural aspects from this novel will not subtract much from it.  The wit is still there, the cartoonish portrayals of certain archetypes and stereotypes are still there, but they are disconnected from the storyline.  I have not read the original inspiration of this story, so perhaps I am missing something here, but if I hadn't read \\"White Teeth\\" I will still have written the same about \\"On Beauty\\". <br /> <br />If you have read \\"White Teeth\\" and really enjoyed it, then \\"On Beauty\\" is worth the price of admission.  If you have not read \\"White Teeth\\" and know Zadie Smith only from book reviews and interviews, I will only hesitatingly recommend this book.  Perhaps it is Smith's familiarity with the British way of life that makes \\"White Teeth\\" appear to be a moreintegral and effortless piece of writing, but both aspects are lacking in this latest novel.	2005-10-13

Nietzsche was raised by his mother, grandmother and aunts; later in his life, his sister would become executor of his estate (after Nietzsche had become incapable of managing his own affairs) and reshape his philosophy and writings in her own idea - this becomes a running motif in later anthologies of Nietzsche; editors can quote and clip to fit their own agendas. In some ways, that is true of the text here, but in much less inappropriate ways than others, particularly Nietzsche's first editor, his sister.<br /><br />Nietzsche was a star pupil from his earliest days at university in Bonn and Leipzig. His formal study was in classical philology, but his attentions turned in various directions quickly during his writing and professional life - he had an intense interest in drama and the arts, with Wagner's music and Greek drama in principal interest. His first book was devoted to these topics - 'The Birth of Tragedy'. It was not highly regarded at the time, but has since become much more appreciated as an anticipation of later developments in philosophy and aesthetics.<br /><br />Nietzsche's life after this period was a very choppy one - he left the university, claiming illness, and while this developed later to be a true situation, at the time is was probably academic politics and difficulties fitting in with the establishment he was trying to break. He had a formal falling-out with Wagner, even writing later a piece entitled ' Nietzsche contra Wagner', finished just a few week prior to his going insane.<br /><br />In another edition, Walter Kaufmann states that Nietzsche's real career took off after his active life was over; under his sister's direction, many of the writings Nietzsche had managed to do and not get published, or which were published but forgotten, really took off in major directions. While his major works of Zarathustra, Ecce Homo, Will to Power and Genealogy of Morals were in various editions of disrepair (indeed, the Will to Power was never more complete than a series of notes), Nietzsche had a knack for language that made him very quotable, and his influence continued to grow well into the first half of the twentieth century, influencing art, philosophy, history, and politics in dramatic ways, if not always the ways in which Nietzsche envisioned.<br /><br />For example, Nietzsche was not particularly impressed with the 'typical' German anti-semitism, which later erupted into the Nazi movement. He considered it rather bourgeois, and while he undoubted had his own issues with Jews (Nietzsche had issues with almost everyone, particularly any group, Christians included, who had a religious connection), the Nazi use of Nietzsche's work owes more to Nietzsche's sister's influence than anyone else.<br /><br />'The Genealogy of Morals' is perhaps the closest in form to English-speaking philosophical discourse. This is a discussion that involves philosophy, psychology and linguistic theory, looking at morality in three different essays. The first essay explores the idea of good and evil as good and bad; Nietzsche develops the idea of master and slave morality - the slave resists the ideas of the master, and thus values things that are less likely to gain power - Nietzsche sees Christianity as an example of slave morality.<br /><br />The second essay looks at the issues of conscience and guilt, and how these spawned the invention of gods. The third essay concludes the work with a look at ascetic ideas, how these relate to aesthetic ideas, and where in Nietzsche's opinion the great philosophers of the past have gone wrong.<br /><br />In his book Ecce Homo (first published posthumously), Nietzsche analyses his own workpiece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life. Nietzsche's insights into his own writings in hindsight is fascinating to behold. His own idea of 'The Genealogy of Morals' can be found in this piece as follows:<br /><br />'Regarding expression, intention, and the art of suprise, the three inquiries which constitute this Genealogy are perhaps uncannier than anything else written so far. Dionysus is, as is known, also the god of darkness.'<br /><br />Nietzsce is not easy reading, and this work is not the best for casual reading or the first-time reader of Nietzsche. However, for those who have already made some headway into understanding him, this is a good volume.e analyses his own work piece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life.

From start to finish, page after page, this gripping book compels the reader to travel alongside Christopher Lawford, joined at the hip.  The reader is transported, heart and mind wholly engaged, as Chris traces his arduous and circuitous path through so many fascinating, high-flying, and contrasting worlds.  In short order, the reader is fully invested in the outcome of this odyssey, drawn into this intense journey by vividly animated prose.  Never a voyeur and no longer a mere observer, the reader thus becomes a participant, experiencing viscerally every nuance of Christopher's story as if it were his or her own, whether or not born to wealth and privilege, whether or not ever substance addicted, whether or not a Kennedy aficionado.  Such is the power, the passion, the immediacy, and the common humanity of this soul-stirring book that it is profoundly and broadly relatable.  It bubbles over with palpable energy. <br /> <br />Extremely well crafted, \\"Symptoms of Withdrawal\\" is a masterful blend of interwoven elements, peppered throughout with historical perspective and keen introspection, ebbing and flowing seamlessly and cohesively.  Though at its core an intimate memoir, it operates at one and the same time as a psychological thriller, a sociological primer, and an entertaining blockbuster, culminating in the uplifting triumph of the human spirit.  <br /> <br />I, personally, could not put the book down and read it cover to cover all through the night and through the next day as well, even forgoing a seminar I had prepaid and had scheduled for that day.  This book packed a wallop, and left me in awe of the author's courage, authenticity, and commitment to transformation.  It's a rare find and a book I look forward to sharing with others.	2005-10-13

But this book is heartfelt, and I feel really touched the essence of the person that Anthony Radziwill was.  I happen to have known him in freshman and sophmore year at Boston University. In freshman year he was in all of my classes. Some mornings I would have coffee and a muffin with him in the coffee shop next to our building, I had no clue who he was other than another BU student hoping to get good grades. He was the most unassuming normal down to earth person you would ever want know. He did have a sophisticated air about him but other than that he was like the rest of us in most ways trying to make our way in life. She knew the 'real' person, and he was conveyed in her book. She obviously had a 'real' relationship with John and Carolyn also. We on the outside only see what we read and hear about in the tabloids - we don't have a real picture of these people. Its a shame that some people are saying Ms. Radziwill is trying to benefit from her name by marriage. She lost her husband, the love of her life, I would think she is using this book as a sort of therapy to help her through what I'm sure have not been an easy six years.

I bought this pocket-sized copy of the Daodejing a year or so ago, because I'd read my friend's copy and it was quite beautifully written. But, ignoring the phrase \\"do your homework,\\" I didn't really know anything about Stephen Mitchell as a translator or how his version fit with other versions that had been done before.  <br /> <br />How interesting for me, then, to hear in my Chinese philosophy class today that Stephen Mitchell is not a translator! He doesn't know any Chinese at all. In fact, most of his works billed as 'translations' are done by reading different existing English translations and compiling them, rephrasing them in the way he likes best. Basically all serious scholars of ancient Chinese texts regard Stephen Mitchell as at best a reinterpretive poet (not a translator), and at worst a charlattan getting money for something he didn't do. <br /> <br />So basically my advice: buy this book if all you want is an easier-to-digest poetic interpretation. But don't buy it if you're looking for a valid scholarly translation. And, if you're as unsettled as I am by how successful Mitchell has been selling \\"translations\\" that he didn't translate, you might not buy it just so he won't make any more money from this venture. <br /> <br />I wanted to give it more stars for its poetic value, but the dishonesty of it being billed as a \\"translation\\" made the rest of it suffer for me. I would encourage you to \\"do your homework\\" and get a more reputable, scholarly, actual translation if you have any desire to learn what the Daodejing is really about.	2005-10-13

Once one of the most produced plays by high schools and colleges it has lost stature and is only produced occasionally.  The reasons for this are a mystery to me.   <br /> <br />As an actor's exercise it offers performers (particularly young ones) a chance to stretch and discover different cultural types. <br /> <br />Based on the ballad \\"Barbara Allen\\" the play about a love affair and marriage between a Witchboy and a beautiful young woman is highly theatrical and filled with a mystical and earthy quality.  Appalachian characters and traditional mountain songs add to the color and whimsical nature of the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Actually it's one of the best books, period. <br /> <br />It's for many reasons: <br /> <br />Firstly, the main character isn't typical. She isn't a geek, a jock, or goth-- She's just...normal. A little sarcastic and anti-social maybe, but I connected with her instantly.  <br /> <br />It's a book that, while being mature, isn't drenched in the usual sex and blood that makes a good vampire book so hard to find. It's a romance, but it's nowhere near sweet. It's not overly wordy, either - you know what's going on.  <br /> <br />Edward is a great character to, and his family is especially endearing - particularly Alice. Meyer's imagination on what vampires would actually be like is really cool. No turning to stone in the sun, folks!  <br /> <br />All in all, I could not put this down. If you're a teen looking for a good read, this is it. If you're an adult in need of a good vampire book or a good romance, it'll satisfy you, to. <br /> <br />One of my favorites, instantly. A lot of romance, some comedy, some blood, some action - you have to read this.	2005-10-13

And also like many of you, I have very little free time to waste on fluff or repackaged ego trips. <br /> <br />So after reading many perceptive and highly various reviews, I electronically threw down my ten bucks and change and got myself a copy of \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" and I haven't looked back since. <br /> <br />The editorial reviews provide enough story outline that I need not repeat it here.  Instead, I will relate the effect this book had on my life. <br /> <br />I read this manual (yes, I see it as a manual, for reasons which will become obvious) in a fevered trance, picturing every nerve-razing detail with hallucinatory clarity.  I read the last sentence, closed the book, and immediately began drinking, sniffing, smoking, and shooting up. <br /> <br />Why would I do such a crazy thing, especially after having finished a tale full of cautionary woe?  Because it is the first step to fame and fortune!  Who can deny the authenticity of the author who willingly and freely indulges his basest needs and then calls them addictions?  I'm not saying it's an easy path.  My alcohol bill alone would fund an ivy-league education, and I apparently owe \\"The Cowboy\\" over fifty Gs in drug money, but these are investments, investments which will bear rich fruit years from now after I get myself detoxed and an agent. <br /> <br />America loves a reformed sinner!	2005-10-13

The Sports Guy does exactly what he sets out to do: talk about sports through the eyes of a fan, leaving all of the passion that we feel about sports intact.  The footnotes are absolutely hilarious (I would literally burst out laughing, realize I was by myself, then with slight remorse, go back to reading) and the insights are excellent.  Setting up the book through the articles is genius because it let's one remember how they felt as it happened.  Writing an entire book, one would not accurately recall their opinions years ago when Manny was signed, etc.  The set up of the book allows for a true understanding of the progession of Sox fans.

It's another great story with wonderful characters we've come to know and love.   <br /> <br />I re-read the earlier books just before Snow & Ashes was published, and must admit that the series struck me a little bit like an old movie serial--with perilous situation after perilous situation.  And read back-to-back like that, it got a tad tedious, though I was pleased that in this book neither Claire nor Jamie were in mortal peril until after page 200.  On the whole, though, I found it a good mix of the exciting and the mundane.  (Unlike some reviewers in this forum, I very much like the depiction of details of their everyday life, and the ways Claire brings a little 20th-century medicine to 18th-century North Carolina.) <br /> <br />I don't quite understand the cries of \\"Cliffhanger. Aaagghh!\\" I've seen here.  I thought the ending was very straight-forward with no major questions left unanswered (except, perhaps, how Roger and Brianna afford their new real estate).  Perhaps I am taking things too much at face value, but I thought many more old questions were answered than new ones asked. <br /> <br />There were some quibbles with the book--I found Jocasta's behavior revealed at the end rather unbelievable, for example--but on the whole I thought it was a great volume.  I, too, enjoyed seeing old friends like Ian and Lord John, and watching Claire and Jamie's relationship mature and develop.  I can't imagine any fan of the series being disappointed in this book.	2005-10-13

When I began reading, I was astonished at all that I didn't know, and, unlike some other reviewers here, I found it interesting, even compelling and certainly consciousness-raising. My husband and I had spent the first six years of our marriage eating anything and everything, getting fat and feeling lousy. Something had to give. Once I understood the theory of protein complementarity, which I subsequently learned not to take deadly seriously,  and then had acquired some very large glass jars and visited my first natural foods co-op, our lives changed dramatically. Being a gourmet cook, I did have to make some adjustments, as Ms. Lappe uses an extremely light hand with seasonings, but her research was sound and her recipes gave me the \\"push\\" I needed to change the way I shopped and cooked and the way we and our toddlers were eating. Twenty years later, I still use the book, as well as another classic, Laurel's Kitchen, and our family consists of four healthy, lean lacto-ovo vegetarian adults. I still have a fond recollection of my early days with my now tattered, rubber-banded copy of Diet for a Small Planet and a sense of gratitude for Ms. Lappe's wake up call which endures today.	2005-10-13

The second was a little harder to get through, about a Polish officer.  The third got to be tendentious, about a Bulgarian operative in Russian security.  Dark Star is the fourth book I've tackled, and while I appreciate Furst's background information, I am getting to wish he didn't provide so much detail.

Giangregorio, Mikko Hrmeinen and Keith Bonn; and, Weapons Tables by Hugh Foster and Keith Bonn.   <br />As Glantz points out in the introduction, the four year struggle ranged over 600,000 square miles and killed tens of millions of soldiers and civilians. He contends that the very size of the Eastern Front War makes it difficult to comprehend it in detail and therefore to place it in context of the Russian contribution to overall victory and this is why this book is such a valuable addition to the literature on the war.  Slaughterhouse places a great deal of information and succinct analysis in the reader's hands. <br />There is a wealth of data in this book, much of it technical.  Organizational tables show the composition of units down to brigade in some cases.  The Orders of Battle list all units from Army Group or Front down to division, along with date of activation, campaign history and successive commanders. As page after page rolls by in this section, 247 pages in fact, the reader can appreciate the massive scale of the conflict in the east. Every weapon used in the theater is listed in comparative tables which are comprehensive and easy to understand. Tanks, tank destroyers, all forms of small arms, all forms of artillery, assault guns, plus aircraft, including lend-lease air planes, appear side by side. Calibre, weight, rate of fire, range, crew, armor thickness, combat radius, speed, it is all here and as is typical of this well-researched book, many photographs of the weapons as well.  <br />Especially useful is the annotated chronology with well-placed maps which, in forty-five pages, provides the reader with an overview of the campaigns. Glantz sees the Battle of  Stalingrad as the decisive turning point of the war.  With regard to relative contributions to victory, Glantz's use of statistics demonstrates that even after the Normandy landings over sixty per cent of the German Army was still in the East and over sixty per cent of its losses as well.  <br />Glantz discusses also the role of Lend-Lease to the Soviets in the Allied victory. He determines that of the matriel the West delivered to the Soviet Union, vehicles, particularly trucks (55% of all used and 42% of jeeps), locomotives and rail cars, contributed most by logistically aiding Red Army offensives. If the Soviets had not received this assistance, he adjudges, it would have taken them 12 to 18 months longer to defeat the Germans.   <br />In the last chapter, Forgotten Battles, Glantz identifies several neglected operations which deserve research.  Here Glantz returns to one of his themes, namely that in order for a proper understanding of the war in the east, more must be known about the numerous counteractions the Red Army undertook during German offensives.  This is particularly so at the strategic level where the main question for Glantz is, to what extent did Stavka co-ordinate them and if so, what did the counteractions contribute to subsequent Soviet failures or successes.  <br />I found the biographical sketches of the senior officers very helpful and informative, especially the thirty-four Soviet portraits of commanders who are little known to the western reader or the Oxford Companion to World War II which has only 14. The book has a large select bibliography, a listof the finding aids for the captured German military documents at the National Archives, and a list of reliable websites.   <br />There is no better way to immerse oneself in the biggest and deadliest front of the war and to come away with informed insight than to read this book. <br />	2005-10-13

His anecdotes and examples are intimate and personal, his treatment of the Scriptural passages is engaging and accessible, and his love for his Savior is evident throughout. People who are interested in thoughtful worship, whether from the leadership point of view or that of the `person in the pew,' will find much in this book to enrich their minds and hearts.<br /><br />Of particular interest are his descriptions and discussion of the various musical types or styles that are in use in worship services. Classical (\\"Bach\\"), folk (\\"Bubba\\") and whatever is culturally `current' (\\"The Blues Brothers\\") are his categories, and these are doubtless familiar to anyone who has experienced worship in a diverse setting. Kidd's reflections on the place for each of these sorts of music and the importance of recognizing all of them in the Voice of the Singing Savior are compelling as we consider our own church environment of worship. Following the lead of the Lead Singer, Jesus, is the most important thing - and our Lead Singer sings in many ways.<br /><br />I found this book moving, enlightening (the discussion of Psalm 22 in relation to worship was particularly so) and engaging in a way that many books about worship are not. I was moved to worship as I read this book, I did not merely read about worship.	2005-10-13

The only prerequisites are a very good understanding of set-theory and some knowledge of the theory of continuous functions (at the level of a first course in real analysis, e.g. Apostol's Mathematical Analysis). The development is patient and there is sufficient help for the beginner (full solutions at the back, and, for practice, unproved propositions in the text with proofs at chapter-ends). The coverage is not overwhelming and anyone with the requisite preparation can digest the book in a term's work. Measure theory on its own is an incredibly dry subject. The authors do a great job of covering the essentials in about 300 pages, while making the subject interesting and applicable at the same time. A very attractive feature of the book is its brief focus on mathematical-finance applications. Most chapters end with a small section on such applications which is very useful for someone simultaneously studying mathematical finance. Particularly, it shows how to conceptualize financial models measure-theoretically. A very useful little volume indeed!	2005-10-13

The following reviews have been taken from the Heal Thyself website...    \\"I have read Ian Cameron's book, `Heal Thyself', and am most impressed by it. It is a record of one man's journey from illness to health and as such will be an inspiration and help to others in a similar position, and is evidence of man's need for spiritual guidance and help. We are all complex beings - physical, mental and spiritual; and our total health and well-being requires the addressing of all these aspects.\\"  -Professor Robert Allen, GP (MD), Donvale Medical Center, Australia     \\"As a natural medicine practitioner for more than fifteen years, I thoroughly enjoyed Ian Cameron's empowering book of self discovery, self healing, recovery to health, and the meaning of life. Ian shows us that anyone who cares about their first asset in life, health, can through their own endeavors, achieve the same ultimate goal of wellness, happiness, and inner peace. I strongly encourage you to read `Heal Thyself' to discover your own inner strength and infinite healing power.\\"  -Dr. Tony Rong, TCM Doctor     \\"Ian Cameron's compilation of his superlative poems in his book, `Heal Thyself', is a fascinating insight into the vast healing powers of the deep `self'. It is based on his own true-life experience of physical and psychological trauma at the threshold of his adult life. I would highly recommend to anyone facing such seemingly insurmountable odds to delve deeply and benefit from `Heal Thyself'.\\"  -Dr. Krys Szatsznajder, GP (MD), Official Doctor for the Australian National Rowing Team     \\"Most of us in our journey through life have inevitably experienced one type of illness or another and some like Ian Cameron have gone through terrible physical and psychological problems. Modern medicine has made enormous strides in understanding many of these diseases but has limited answers in curing many of them. Ian's search for answers led him inwards to profound knowledge and eventual cure, which he has effectively and inspiringly brought out in his book `Heal Thyself'.\\"  -Dr. Sriram Gopathy, GP (MD), Melbourne, Australia    \\"Here is a gentle and subtle poetry by Ian Cameron, which will help a lot in understanding and overcoming the emotional problems. Good thing about his poetry is it places the responsibility of your well-being squarely where it belongs, with you. But if you make that commitment to yourself, you'll be richly rewarded.\\"  -Dr. Shashikant Patwardhan, Ayurvedic Doctor, India    \\"In 1980, I read Dr. Ainslie Meares book of poems, entitled `Cancer: Another Way', and was impressed with the power of poetry to describe inner healing states. Through his own healing experience, Ian Cameron has brought back some poetic gems from a deep place within. His book, `Heal Thyself', is a valuable source of inspiration for those with chronic illness and stress.\\"  -Dr. Peter Johnston, GP (MD), Family Doctor and Counselor for 35 years	2005-10-13

Her life is overflowing with one thing after another.  She is a greeting card artist, is working on owning her own Greeting Card store, is dealing with a group of off kilter frinds (very, loyal friends), a brother in a mental hospital and an uncle who maybe should be.  Throw into this that she is part of a dating project in which she has to date 40 men in 60 days.  She has plenty to do. <br /> <br />While on a late night visit to the mental hospital to take her brother aluminum foil (read the book to find out why :)), she first sees a dead body on the way to the hospital lying in the road.  Since she fears that her brother has knowledge of it, or may have something to do with it, she takes no immediate action.  While at the hospital, she is taken somewhat hostage by a man pretending to be a doctor who is actually running from the mob, and has some knowledge of why the guy is dead in the road.   <br /> <br />What follows is a completely amusing and engrossing tale of how this all works out in a really fresh new way of doing so.  I found certain elements just a little far fetched (can't tell you what they are without giving something important away), I still found it a very good read and am currently reading the second in the series. <br /> <br />I found Wollie to be a fun herione with a lot of very real elements about her.  You can't help but like her and look forward to what she might do next.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  I did recognize that the author was an actress and do know who she is.  I don't see why some have made that an issue.  I think her work as an author and as an actress stand alone and speak for themselves.  I recommend her both as an author and an actress.	2005-10-13

The exercises outlined in this book, which I learned in conjunction with physical therapists associated with the New York University medical center, have been immensely helpful in preventing on-going pain and any severe reoccurrence.   <br /> <br />Of course, you should do these exercises only with the consultation of a doctor and/or physical therapist, especially if you have acute back pain caused by a protruding or ruptured disc. Also, of course, you should combine them (eventually) with a program to strengthen and stretch your muscles.  But, as many of you know, with back pain it can be very difficult to do these other exercises until you have found fundamental relief to the underlying causes of the pain, and these exercises, properly applied and for the right cases, can accomplish this. <br /> <br />The limited amount of time they take (litereally a couple of minutes) make these exercises very easy to maintain over time. <br /> <br />Robin McKenzie has been acknowledged around the world for his work with back pain.  His credentials are strong.  If you have found many other books to be generic and not that helpful, this one is different.  If the \\"popularizer\\" title puts you off, or if you are wanting a more in-depth anlaysis-- even if only to reassure yourself of the legitamacy of the medicine behind the exercises-- you can buy and read the formal textbooks he has written. <br /> <br />Good luck!	2005-10-13

I have to say that this is an incredibly disappointing book. One would expect by the title that some form of rationale would be presented for supporting the title's claim but the author fails to provide any such thing. Instead, she squanders a wonderful opportunity by abusing the medium to vilify dispensationalists and dispensationalism and her disdain for such fills nearly the whole book like shrapnel from a hand grenade. She also notes an author who \\"points of the danger of anti-Semitism in dispensationalism.\\" This is absolute rubbish. While I have only been familiar with dispensationalism for a few years I have yet to notice anything resembling the like in any of their writings. One thing the author absolutely should not have done is equate the apocalyptic vision in Revelation with the \\"apocalyptic\\" story of Dickens's \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" She goes to great lengths to try and establish a connection between the two but she never really succeeds. The author also has the temerity to suggest that the plagues in Revelation may be punishment for the social ills and injustice that have been committed. There is absolutely nothing whatsoever to support this fantasy. Near the end of the book we are finally led to know just why she published this book. The book of Revelation presents a sequence of events put in motion by God to right all of the social ills and injustice in the world. We find that she interprets Revelation according to her own populist theology. God is avenging the downtrodden. It is this reviewer's hope that because of this reinterpretation this book will receive a very short shelf life.	2005-10-13

Kostova's writing is atmospheric and quite good, permeating the novel with a pleasant creepiness.  Although it is admittedly long, the rewards here are more subtle than one might expect.  Many parallels can be drawn with Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code (I won't go into them here lest I give anything away), but in the end this is simply a different sort of book.  This is a book for lovers of history, the sort who don't mind lengthy descriptions of culture and architecture.  These passages, which do little to advance the plot, were still interesting to me because I know little of Eastern Europe or Turkey.  These are the places where East and West begin to blend, and Kostova depicts the result vividly.  I believe expectations of a fast-paced, Da Vinci-like thriller may have ruined this book for some. <br /> <br />That being said, The Historian has its flaws.  There were simply too many fortuitous coincidences, too many trustworthy people, too many unanswered questions.  Characters' reactions to certain events seemed unrealistic.  Again, examples would threaten to give away important plot points later in the book. <br /> <br />Overall, though, Kostova's first effort is impressive, and it will be interesting to see how she follows it up. <br /> <br />Note: some reviews further down give away the ending, so readers who have not read or finished the book may want to be careful.	2005-10-13

Dick	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An impressive memoir	This book was a fascinating read about an author named Philip K. Dick who was a very uncommon breed. Carrere takes the reader through the journey of this man's life from the infant death of his twin sister, to the multiple marriages he experienced, to his upsetting lonely death. Throughout all of this, the reader learns of how involved the human brain can truly be, especially in the case of Philip K. Dick.<br /><br />Although I had never read any of Philip K. Dick's work before, Emanuel Carrere's depiction of his life was quite interesting. However, in Carrere's book, there was some confusion between the descriptions of Dick`s actual life, and the parts which were only the autobiographical aspects that he had written about in his own novels. The \\"journey into the mind of Philip K. Dick\\" was a fascinating journey to take, and without giving too much away, I do not think that any regular person really knows someone of Philip's character. Perhaps there are some aspects of his enigmatic mind that each one of us holds, but the intricacy that was described in Carrere's creative way held a hazy difference between the reality and the imaginary. Perhaps these two things can be easily confused, as they seem to have been by Dick, in my opinion. Either way, Carrere wrote an impressive memoir that showed all of the details of Philip K. Dick's life, when really picked through, and I can assume that the other authors who have written about him could not have done nearly as good of a job.<br /><br />Reviewed by a student for Flamingnet Book Reviews<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations	2005-10-13

Most of the reviewers spend time (and, undoubtedly their personal biases) on extraneous portions of this work.  The message is \\"We are in mortal danger\\". <br /> <br />Why?  Because Islam is on-the-march!!!  Even Mr. Blankly underplays the dangers when he mentions (on page.42) the five pillars of Islam (Prayer, fasting, almsgiving, profession of faith and pilgimage) in the context that jihad is not one of them such that it is not important to muslims.  (Indeed, according to Robert Spencer, Alvin Schmidt, Paul Sperry, Amir and Ergun Caner there are multiple places in the Koran calling for jihad.) <br />If anyone imagines that jihad is not part and parcel of Islam, consider:  When Mohammed finally succeeded in Medina he killed those not part of his group. When he went from there to Mecca, he killed.  And, after his death, the Arab hordes rose up out of the peninsula to spread Islam, killing, into the green crescent, Asia Minor, North Africa, Spain, southern France, eastward and to the very gates of Vienna - killing, killing, killing.  If anyone thinks for one minute that Islam is not a viscious power, they do so at their own peril.  Simply look at muslim behavior and listen to what they say.  Yes, there are peaceful muslims - those who don't read the \\"Book\\" and those whose own sense of humanity somehow overrides that which they are supposed to believe. <br /> <br />This book is a must read for our national leaders and all who are in a position to defend our culture and our nation. <br /> <br />Mark A.

The authors, Bing West and Major General Ray L. Smith, traveled with the division during their campaign that began at the Kuwaiti border and ended with them in the heart of Baghdad itself.   <br /> <br />The book starts out with the battle to take the Az Zubayr pumping station (dubbed the \\"Crown Jewel\\") near the Kuwait border to prevent a repeat of what Saddam did in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War.  After that it details the advance of the three RCTs and the critical battles they faced at places like An Nasiriyah.  Finally, after crossing the Tigris and linking up just North of Al Kut, RCTs 1,5, and 7 struck towards Baghdad.  And as you all know Baghdad fell on April 9th with Saddam's statue being torn down and the rest is history.   <br /> <br />Now for the criticisms of the book.  While this was very informative and had some good details of the action, there were parts of the book that were quite boring.  I think this comes from the fact that the authors include themselves too much in the book and mostly only detail the fighting they actually saw.  But overall it was worth the read and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to know more about the Iraq War.	2005-10-13

It is basically an unknown story, since what they teach us in school is almost all of it lies and myths, for example that Queen Elizabeth sold her jewells to finance the first trip, or that everybody in Columbus' time believed the Earth was flat. By any standard, Columbus was a bit of a lunatic who probably also suffered from what todat we call bipolar disease (for example, he thought that God spoke to him directly). He seems to have been given to theatricality and emotional blackmail, but undoubtedly he was also very intelligent and a great navigator. He also had an urge for social climbing, and he longed for glory and fame more than for money. He was obsessed with finding a way to China, India and Japan by sailing West, which suited the Western European powers's commercial interests. As said before, in his time the great debate among learned people was not over the flatness or roundness of the Earth, but about its size. Columbus, by grossly underestimating it, became convinced that the voyage to Asia was within reach. Had there been no American continent, he would have been murdered or starved to death. But he was also a very courageous and brave man, and so he made possible what seemed impossible. He was a very bad politician, and his emotional diseases made him quarrel with soon former friends, which of course marred his leadership abilities. His life, very well written by Fernandez-Armesto, is a glorious, tragic and incredible epic which reads like the best adventure novels.	2005-10-13

This is Sabrina Jeffries' final entry in her Royal Brotherhood series.  A series of books dedicated to three brothers, born on the wrong side of George IV (Prinny's) imperial blankets. Ms. Jeffries is an author known for her light, humorous writing style, and here she continues in that gifted vein.  ONE NIGHT WITH A PRINCE is light and at times it is humorous, but, as a story, it has little diversion and much predictability.<br /><br />Mr. Gavin Byrne is a womanizing gambler.  Throughout London, they know him as a man without a soul.  This 'Prince of Sin' does not believe in love, and he certainly does not believe in the sacrament of marriage.  He lives for pleasure, enjoyment, and satisfaction - his own! So what is it about the riotous little 'Colonel Christabel' that is turning his world upside down?<br /><br />Christabel, the Marchioness of Haversham, is desperate!  Her late husband's betrayal is rearing its ugly head. Stolen letters, entrusted to her, are currently being used in a blackmail scheme - a blackmail scheme against his royal highness.  A scheme fueled by her now-deceased spouse.  Christabel must get the damaging letters back and reluctantly, she must ask for help - help from the notorious Gavin Byrne.<br /><br />ONE NIGHT WITH A PRINCE starts with much pizzazz - the duel of wicked whist, in Lady Haversham's parlor, is delightfully lusty.  However, shortly after this delectable scene, Jeffries' story begins to stutter and stumble.  Although Jeffries' pace is even and her characters are spirited, her story becomes ordinary - plausibly because the author exposes intense background information far too early - nothing dynamic is left - nothing left to intrigue the reader.  Yes, as an author, Ms. Jeffries is a powerful force, but, this time, this talented writer exposes her cards far too early.

As a BIG fan of well-plotted spy/adventure yarns, I have been frantically searching for someone, ANYONE who could fill the HUGE shoes left by Robert Ludlum after his death.  Without a doubt, Ted Bell IS the man to do it.  However as a reviewer also mentioned, he is too unique in his own right to assume somone elses spot.  He has created his own place in the world adventure/fiction, and he has done it quickly and he has done it very well.<br /><br />Just a few minutes of reading any of Bell's 3 novels and you can sense he just writes differently than what you normally find in this particular genre.  There is almost a harmony to how the sentences flow.  All I can say is in this case, Different isn't just good, it's GREAT.<br /><br />With Pirate, we see Alexander Hawke on his most daring mission yet.  A crazed decendant of Napoleon has a plan to unite China and France together against virtually any and all nations in order to pull off a frightening scenario that includes the Middle East and the one thing they produce more of than almost any other place on earth: Oil.  At first I thought that nobody in France or China could be stupid enough to pull off such an insane stunt, but trust me as you read Pirate, you will be utterly shocked at not how realistic it all is, but just how downright PLAUSIBLE it is.  Shockingly realistic.<br /><br />Do yourself an immense favor and give Ted Bell a shot.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Yeah, I know I've heard that one before and it certainly SEEMS like an overused cliche, but in this particular case, I simply cannot endorse this guy enough.  But if I could also bend your eye for just a few moments longer, if you take my advice, begin with 'Hawke' and then move on to 'Assassin' before reading 'Pirate'.  NOT because you must read them in order, they are ALL excellent, but they simply get BETTER.  I cannot WAIT for Alex Hawke's next outing.  Yes, the book is THAT good.	2005-10-13

It was too long, too natural-sy looking and seemed too boring for me to read for a long time. When I did read it, it became part of me but I could never guess at how important it would become to me until some twenty years later.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I decided to write an honours thesis in my chosen area of English Literature. And what was the most valuable book I'd ever read and that was more worthy of academic study than any other? A Girl of the Limberlost. It is the flagship book for my studies in American nature writing. Although  I'm currently journeying through all the big guns - Thoreau. Whitman, Abbey etc., none as yet hold a candle to the Limberlost, an intriguing mix of swampland and some of the tallest timber in the United States. Admittedly, the plot is trite, the ending disappointing, the characters slightly unbelievable, but there is something that lifts this book above its own flaws and I really think that's the nature writing sequences. And the way people are incorporated into that nature.<br /><br />It's also the deeply rooted sense of Americana in the story. From the descriptions of food and clothes to the long, unsealed roads, I think this book is the best introduction for young female readers into American ethics, style and enterprise in the early twentieth-century. It certainly gave me, an Australian, a taste of Americana which has proved more useful and comforting than I could have ever imagined. I recommend it without reserve for any reader, but particularly young girls. I just wish I could remember who gave it to me. I'd love to say thanks.	2005-10-13

Perhaps a bit more darker than the previous two, and very much less romance.  Someone was always falling in love in Atwater-Rhodes other two books.  In this one, we are transported about 20 years in the future to the son of the two Falcon warriors.  He's miserable and loney and when one day he nearly dies by crashing from the sky, he discovers he must go to the falcon kingdom (basically the enemies of his parents) to be tutored.  I don't want to say more, since Atwater-Rhodes books are so short and concise.  I would hate to give away the story.<br /><br />Of course I'm suggesting that you read it.

Sir Gawain was everything a knight should be considering the fact that he's not perfect due to the fact that he's human.  The animals depicted in the hunting scenes directly tie in with the storyline with Sir Gawain and the lady of the castle.  The deer represented that Sir Gawain tried to flee away from having to deal with the lady of the castle.  The wild boar represented difficulty since it was stated that the boar in the hunt had killed a man.  Finally, the fox represented the fact that Sir Gawain was planning to be sly and conceal the fact that the lady of the castle had given him her girdle.  The fact that he would lie to the lord of the castle, shows that he is truly human and that he would like to keep his own head when he has to go meet back up with the Green Knight the following day.  The hunt over three days represents a series of three tests which later comes to aid or hinder Sir Gawain in his quest to keep his oath as a knight and follow through with the guidelines of \\"the beheading game\\".  The girdle at the end that all the knights in King Arthur's court take to wearing symbolizes that they are human and that they are not perfect and that humility should be observed.	2005-10-13

I'm learning to speak Italian on my free time and i thought that since i read the Bible anyway, why not learn Italian and read my Bible at the same time?  There's a couple of issues i have though, the Italian used in this Bible is sort of an old Italian language, with words being written slightly different than they are in my Italian language dictionary.  Also, for example, the book of Eclesiastes has either additianal verses in the last chapter or the verse numbering has been changed and made longer. I've noticed this in other places in this Bible as compared to the KJV version.  Also translations change from English to Italian. I also compared the Spanish (Reina-Valera) version of the Bible to this Italian Bible and they are more similar. Over all i'm having fun reading the Bible in Italian.  The Word of God is beautiful in any language! God Bless! and happy reading.	2005-10-13

Sadly this early introduction to the supposedly \\"modern\\" notion of \\"open theism\\" is merely Socinianism redressed in new clothes, the most prominent spokesmen being Carl Bangs, Clark Pinnock and Greg Boyd.  Why ostensibly educated people are so taken by their vacuous \\"arguments\\" is a mystery; it's just a repeat of \\"Did God say?\\" back in Genesis 3.  Satan need not think up any new lies when man keeps falling for the same old one and the frightening thing is that one must wonder if or how as with Adam, these people are also not deceived, but are eating this forbidden fruit knowingly.  1 Timothy 2:14.  God knows - whether they shake their impotent fists against Him or not.  When one compares the awesome prodigous inspiration and brilliance of saints like Augustine who have illumined Christ's Church for so many centuries with the puny little incredibly arrogant figures of those who decide to reject him like Pinnock, one doesn't know whether to laugh or to cry.  How like modernity's view of \\"truth\\" as having nothing to do with veracity, of whether anything is even a proposition, much less whether it's true or false, but rather exclusively utilitarian, something to be used for power aggrandizement.  But as with Naziism and Communism, these devils break their pawns and will horribly destroy them either here or in the hereafter.  Matthew 10:28.  See this illustrated in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" by C.S. Lewis and the horrible end of the sagacious Frost and Wither, both appropriately named, especially the latter.  God is in full control as a profoundly happy God whose joy is our strength.  May people turn to that joyful truth and away from this sad book of delusion.  Nehemiah 8:10.	2005-10-13

No one would be foolish enough to categorically deny the possibility.  Nonetheless, we can say that if there is such a process, no one has a clue how it would work.  Further, it would go against all human experience, like postulating that a natural process might explain computers.\\"  \\"In the face of the massive evidence we do have for biochemical design, ignoring that evidence in the name of a phantom process would be to play the role of the detectives who ignore an elephant\\".<br /><br />Well this is just riddled with logical loops and holes.  First, who is he to say that no one has a clue how it would work?  He has already stated (pp 189-192) that Stuart Kauffman and others claim they have a clue, but he has already peremptorily dismissed them so now he is going to ignore them.  Second why does it go against all human experience?  We have ample human experience of coming to understand new natural processes and laws that have opened up whole new ways of understanding.  Theories of gravity, electromagnetic forces, atomic structure, DNA replication come immediately to mind.  So it is not at all beyond human experience to discover a new natural process with major explanatory power.  Third, what is illogical about postulating that a natural process explains computers?  Humans are natural systems, human culture is a natural system, and computers have arisen from that natural system.  Our computers are crude and undeveloped compared to the computational systems of the human brain or any organism's ability to derive and process information from its environment. Electronic computers are the result of natural processes which can occur when natural systems like human beings emerge from cellular structures.  Fourth, the conclusion of biochemical design is what is on trial when he suggests that an undiscovered natural process might be an alternative explanation for the \\"evidence\\" !  He can't then logically claim that the very same evidence rules out the undiscovered process!  This paragraph alone is enough to toss Behe onto the intellectual rubbish heap!<br /><br />Behe puts forth what I will accept as strong arguments that the theory of gradual mutation and natural selection is insufficient to explain biochemical processes and structures.  He then waves his hands, metaphorically speaking, in two chapters about intelligent design, using very poor logic.  He dismisses other people who agree with the limits of natural selection, using deprecatory tactics to deflect legitimate investigation into their work.  He mentions how Lynn Margulis was \\"initially patronized and ridiculed, [then] eventually won grudging acceptance - and then acclaim - for her idea that parts of the cell were once free-living organisms.  But, he points out, symbiosis, although important, cannot explain the origin of complex biochemical systems.  He then proceeds to himself patronize and ridicule Stuart Kauffman who does put forth a promising framework for the origin of complex biochemical systems.  First he directly equates Kauffman's proposals on biological systems with \\"complexity theory\\" itself, describes complexity theory as \\"a mathematical concept to describe the behavior of some computer programs\\", and makes it sound as if Kauffman himself is a computer jockey playing artificial life games rather than an Marshall scholar, MD, Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Biotech company founder, and recipient of numerous prestigious awards and fellowships.  Kauffman's resume ([...]) makes Behe look like a grad student.  Behe mixes up Kauffman's ideas with others less profound, picks out pieces out of context, and then states that \\"this aspect of complexity theory\\" requires pre-existing, already functioning systems.  Behe finishes his dismissal of one of the most interesting investigations into the origins of life with a patronizing concluding paragraph:<br /><br />\\"Complexity theory may yet make important contributions to mathematics, and it may still make modest contributions to biochemistry.  But it cannot explain the origin of the complex biochemical structures that undergird life.  It doesn't even try.\\"<br /><br />In the dynamics of polemic discourse, Behe has just \\"inoculated\\" the reader who has yet to read Kauffman against these ideas which directly challenge Behe's conclusions.  The Behe reader now may think they know something about Kauffman and his ideas and that they are unimportant instead of powerful.  Behe performs an even more egregious \\"inoculation\\" when he misquotes Daniel Dennett to make him sound like a nut-case rather than the profound rationalist and meticulous logician that he is.  Behe is a crusader for God, and he doesn't want you to open your mind to these \\"godless\\" intellectuals.<br /><br />Behe is then so bold as to declare, in his concluding chapter, that the cumulative efforts of cellular biological investigation clearly and unambiguously point to intelligent design.  He then mournfully suggests that the scientific community's failure to embrace and announce that conclusion stems from various cultural pressures.  He examines and dismisses what he claims are the main arguments against intelligent design, but he conveniently overlooks the most potent argument that is the real reason the scientific community has not accepted intelligent design:  it doesn't provide any useful knowledge.<br /><br />Intelligent Design is a way of giving up.  Behe doesn't say \\"Look, natural selection may be necessary but it isn't sufficient to explain things the way they are.  Let's open our minds to new ways of thinking.  Maybe there is a natural principle right under our noses that we have been blind to.\\".  That's what Kaufmann says, but Behe says no, don't bother to try to find a natural principle for these problems.  They are too complex to have arisen on their own.  God created them.  Even if all these systems existed \\"in the mind of God\\" before they came into creation, how did they come into creation?  What are God's physical methods?  Those are the \\"as-yet undiscovered natural processes\\" that Behe would dismiss.<br /><br />Therefore, what Behe is really trying to do is to convince us to keep our minds closed.

Races and cities rise and fall, lots of good folks just inexplicably go \\"mad,\\" and that's all before the art!  No, actually, I don't.<br /><br />Warcraft is written by a guy whose imagination is in overdrive.  If this is a trilogy, and not a thirty-volume manga, such a background story was really uneccesary.  What saves this manga is the art.<br /><br />Korean artist Jae-Hwan Kim draws really exciting art.  You feel like you are in the story.  Kim has an incredible sense of space, dimension, and proportion.  The characters designs and clothing are to die for.  The men are men's men, but wear intricate clothing and armor.  The women are beautiful, with lovely clothes.  Forests and mountains don't look like backdrops, but like the real thing.  You can almost smell the pine trees.<br /><br />Richard A. Knaak has a \\"knack\\" for storytelling, when the manga finally begins.  It is a good tale of good vs. evil in a fantasy land.  Dragon Kalec has taken human form when he is attacked by a band of orcs led by a dragon-hating dwarf.  Injured, Kalec is led to safety by a beautiful, naiive peasant girl named Anveena.<br /><br />Anveena is so dumb, she makes TV's Crank Yanker's Special Ed look like a genius.  (Yay!)  If she were as ugly as she is stupid, Kalec would run like hell.  As it is, she is very pretty, and Kalec feels a bond with her, even though he is engaged to the Dragon Tyrl.  Tyrl is smart, beautiful, and arrogant.  Soon they are engaged in bloody, (well-drawn) battles with orcs and the undead.  Seeing someone fighting with his guts hanging out is pretty cool.<br /><br />I would get this trilogy just for the art.	2005-10-13

Nothing I've ever read had such a thick storyline or plot as The City of Ember. But, it has some dragging parts in the middle, like about the main character's grandmother losing something. The City of Ember is a very interesting book to read, and I suggest it to avid readers who are sick of the Harry Potter Series or sick of waiting for some book to come out. <br /> <br />I like the mystery in the City of Ember, and I can see a very clear message from the author. Usually, some books don't have a clear purpose or message from the author because it's like some fantasy book. But The City of Ember is rare in that way. <br /> <br />The City of Ember is a kind of alien to the other books, and that's what makes the suspense. The main characters are Lind Mayfleet and Doon Harrow, two friends who are exactly opposite of each other. They solve the mysterys of their city with clues everywhere with the lights flickering....... <br /> <br />To find out what happens to Lina and Doon, read this book. It is worthwhile to read The City of Ember!	2005-10-13

I almost didn't buy it because I thought It would be too difficult to drag myself through all of the game specific terminology since I don't play the game. I was WRONG. Dan Abnett truly tells a compelling, in-depth, page turner of a story that's 1 part Sherlock Holmes, 1 part Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1 part Lovecraft's Cthulu. The Eisenhorn Ominbus edition covers all three books and 2 chronlogically organized short stories.   <br /> <br />Inquisitor Eisenhorn is truly a character you can invest in and his tragic flaws only make more him more endearing and believable. This is not a superhero, James Bond series where the main characters always save the day and emerge unscathed. These stories are really about Eisenhorn's transformation as he is drawn deeper and deeper into crossing the line of heresy in his crusade to save humanity from the terrors of Chaos. How much sacrifice is acceptable and can the ends justify the means? The beauty of this SF epic is that Eisenhorn explores these concepts while providing a blood-soaked, action packed, thriler of a ride.  <br /> <br />I just chucked Dune and Starhship Troopers off my bookshelf. Eisenhorn deserves to stand alone at the top of the SF heap. My best comparison is LOTR. This is a definite buy-it-in-hardback-if-you-can-find-it so it can endure the wear of re-reading.	2005-10-13

It is very evident that the book was written by a teenager, but I think that's one things I liked about it.

As an avid fantasy reader I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, whether it be fantasy or not.  To those of you who stress out about the small things, such as the similarities to other authors and obvious clues Eragon should be picking up on, I recommend you get out of your mom's basement and put the dungeons and dragons board away (or whatever it is you use to play the game)!

Volume 3 (v. 3)	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Souvenirs,Flowers and Fireworks	\\"Yotsuba&!\\" Volume 3 continues the adventures of everybodys favorite green haired rascal. <br /> <br />Like the previous volumes, each chapter deals with Yotsuba engaging everyday activities and we,the readers,are treated to her happiness. <br /> <br />The first chapter,\\"Souvenirs\\" concludes the last chapter from volume 2 where Asagi returns from Okinawa with gifts for her family and of course,Yotsuba.She decides to return the favor with a \\"souvenir\\" of her own(which sparks a memory from Asagi's childhood which is touched upon later on).We're also introduced to a new character,Torako,Asagi's cigarate smoking friend. <br /> <br />\\"Asagi\\" has Yotsuba waiting for another souvenir from the long haired lady next door.Yotsuba's reaction when she discovers Asagi didn't pick her up anything is dead on to what a real kid would do in the same situation.Later,the girls set off fireworks(including one on top of Torako's Car!) <br /> <br />We learn something new about Jumbo in \\"Flowers\\" as Yotsuba takes a trip to the Florist with Fuka and returns with flowers...ALOT of flowers for just 10 yen(read to find out how). <br /> <br />\\"The Bon Festival\\" has Yotsuba dressed as The Flower Cupid,a perfect way for Koiwai(Yotsuba's Dad) to get rid of the flowers from the previous chapter.In her adorable outfit,Yotsuba is told to go around the neighborhood and give away the remaining flowers.During her tour,she encounters a number of people, including a Female Police Officer(the scene in question has a nice reference to the Water Gun from volume 2). <br /> <br />\\"The Elephant\\",my favorite chapter in this book,has Yotsuba's first trip to the Zoo.There are plenty of Animal moments with Yotsuba(Her punching out a Goat is one of the highlights of this volume) and also quite one with her and her Dad. <br /> <br />By far the most shocking moment occurs in \\"The Fireworks Show?\\"...We FINALLY meet Ena,Fuka and Asagi's Father(the one Asagi never remembers and thinks is dead).Jumbo also tries to use Yotsuba to ask Asagi to go to the Fireworks Show with him...which leads into the last chapter:\\"The Fireworks Show!\\" <br />While this is really just a repeat of the \\"Asagi\\" chapter it does have some new material,like a frustrated Jumbo asking Miura,Ena's short haired friend, if she's a boy or girl and scenes in which the girls take advantage of Jumbo's crush on Asagi to buy food and play the games at the show. <br /> <br />Once again,we have solid artwork from Kiyohiko Azuma,whose character designs are one of the main highlights of each volume.While the plots are fun in this collection,they weren't  as crazy as the first two volumes(which isn't a bad thing)they were more relaxed.If this volume had any weak points it would be we didn't receive any new details on Yotsuba's Mom or her life overseas and also there weren't any Translation Notes(some more facts on The Bon Festival would have been helpful). <br /> <br />Funny,cute and sweet.A highly recommended title.	2005-10-13

After getting to know her hard-working local sanitation workers and touring some nearby staging areas, Royte ran into trouble when asking to inspect the modern for-profit landfills. (NYC garbage often ends up in landfills in my ever-so-accepting state of Pennsylvania.) Landfills are now gigantic corporate operations where secrecy rules, as if they have something to hide from irate citizens or nosy government inspectors. I was disappointed that Royte gave up on the landfills so easily, because if she had stuck with her detective work, she could have written a powerhouse investigative report on this shifty business. Royte has better luck with following her recycled items, gaining much insight into the nature of recycling operations, from the questionable economics of citizen sorting efforts to whether or not recycling things really saves energy or raw materials. The answers to these questions will probably be more depressing than you expect.<br /><br />Royte's coverage of recycling turns out to be the most useful aspect of this book, and you may conclude that it's not all it's cracked up to be. That's because Royte shows that consumer and household waste actually makes up just a tiny percentage of what goes to landfills, and quaint small-scale efforts by individual citizens barely make a dent when large-scale commercial and industrial operations are given no reason to reduce their infinitely greater amounts of waste. Eventually, the book narrows down its arguments to the real benefits of reducing consumption and consumerism, because in theory we won&#8217;t have to worry about disposing of waste that is never created in the first place. (A New York City sanitation official provided the telling quote that I used as the title of this review.) Unfortunately, Royte jumps around among a great many smaller issues in refining this concept, which results in quick and spotty coverage of many important aspects of the garbage universe, while the reduce-reuse-recycle consensus is not backed up by any corroborated economics or authoritative philosophy. That gives this book a scattershot, unfocused, and inconclusive feel, though the basic information is certainly useful for those concerned about their own ecological footprint.

What happens to Anna Franklin? She is thirty-nine, very attractive, \\"pretty was always too tame a word,\\" a single mother and journalist, who goes for a short vacation to Italy, leaving her six-year-old daughter with friends in London. When she does not return, her friends are justifiably alarmed, but knowing Anna's reliability they invent rational reasons for her continued absence - until it becomes apparent that she may never return.<br /><br />The two different accounts of Anna's adventures are cleverly interwoven with the narrative of what occurs at home with the daughter and friends who wait, as we wait, to discover just what is going on. The author also takes us on a journey into Anna's past to further develop her character. This chilling novel promises answers but never really delivers. Ms. Dunant's writing is taut and suspenseful. She is a three time finalist for the Golden Dagger Award. This is a novel you won't be able to put down - an engrossing read!<br /><br />JANA	2005-10-13

The use of colour, and in particular colour chart relating frequency ranges in descriptive terms is handy. The orchestration tips on achieving specific moods is also useful and innovative. The book does not seem to me to be crammed with information.

The COT report is unique to futures however Larry has developed another indicator that provides a similar indicator that is applicable to stocks and futures markets that do not have COT reports available. Exit criteria are discussed on numerous occasions. While entrances are subjective Larry mentions this repeatedly, saying that trading involves 2 steps: 1) setup, which the COT reports can help provide and 2) entry trigger, which he provides some simple techniques he has used over the years.  <br /> <br />While there are references to his advisory and educational services as well as the data/charting company that he uses they are not simply marketing gimmicks. When I study analysts, advisors and the like I prefer to be able to exactly duplicate their studies and verify them for myself and Larry's references are very beneficial in that regard. <br /> <br />Larry is truly one of the good guys in this oft misunderstood industry.

I have loved Carlyle's past books because they were dark, sensual, humorous, and manned by vivid,unforgettable characters. Not to mention that she put her own stamp upon the Regency Historical sub-genre by exploring things that most RH authors don't. But One Little Sin is very conventional. Carlyle's stunning prose is evident, but her beautiful characterizations and use of setting flicker on and off throughout the book, leaving me unsatisfied and confused as to whom I was reading. From the beginning of book, I found myself impatient to finish it, and highly anticipating the next two books of the trilogy.

Don later says to her, \\"I'm told you have a list?\\"  She replies, \\"No sir.  It's just these shoes.\\"  A discussion about hedgehogs prompted by Frank's almost running over a dead one on the highway leads to his assertion that in American some people keep them as pets. Don cautions that you can't believe all what you hear;  some of it is just anti-American propaganda.

It's fresh, with practical approaches that I've been applying in many communication situations.  THEY'VE WORKED! Some books make 'persuasion' feel more like 'manipulation'.  This author shows how persuading someone can be the end result of a relationship built on trust and an authentic awareness and interest in the other person.  Most importantly, there are lots of clear tools to help practice what she suggests. <br /> <br />For example, I am more aware of my attention and have gotten much better at paying attention by applying her advice.  Again, it's not about manipulating, but about really listening.  Erickson writes \\"Giving someone else your attention is a way of treating them, and yourself, with real respect.  It can't be faked.\\"  And she tells you HOW to do this better. <br /> <br />Also, there's a great list of questions to help prepare for an important meeting or phone call.  My book naturally falls open to pages 96 and 97 because I refer to them so often.  They help me get the focus off of myself and onto what's important to the other person/people.  I feel so much more prepared and confident when I use these questions to guide my planning. <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but one other way Erickson's book has had an impact on my communication is the \\"levels of engagement\\" she describes when having a chance encounter.  She asks: Are you engaging to be polite (hearing but not listening) - Level 1.  Or, engaging to be right (I know what you're going to say, I might even finish your sentences) - Level 2.  Level 3: engaging selectively (I have a pretty good idea about how I want this chance meeting to turn out because I know what you do for a living and it relates to what I do -- there could be a good opportunity here).  Or, Level 4: engaging to learn. (I want to understand as much as possible about you in the time available and under the circumstances.  Let's enjoy this chance meeting.) She writes more about each level but they really helped me realize how I was treating these situations - at conferences, cocktail parties, airplane rides.  Engaging to learn has had a tremendous impact on relationships I've developed (and business opportunities that have resulted much more naturally, genuinely, and enjoyably). <br /> <br />It's an easy to read guide that will encourage you to connect in a more meaningful way with others and will give you practical ways to make your communication more effective. <br />	2005-10-13

I won't give too much of description of the story except to say that finally I found a hero that did the right thing for the woman he loved without equivication and there was still a story.  He loves her. Simple as that.  So romantic.   <br /> <br />Why not five stars?  Well there was the snoozing at the beginning but that isn't the reason why.  I was annoyed with the high number of questions that was answered with a question.  Also inner dialogue that was frought full of questions and thoughts that should have been spoken aloud weren't.  I found myself searching for a response and then had to back up a few times to figure out that the passage wasn't spoken, simply thought. Kinda frustrating.	2005-10-13

The book presents Jesus in a non-threatening way.  Jesus cares for the protagonist in a personal way as he explains who he is and why he is the most important person in history.  Jesus rebuts a few attacks related to other religions and not forcing himself on us.  All this through a dinner conversation.  In the end, the book is a good evangelistic tool that presents Jesus in his fullness, but more of a loving warm fuzzy than a judgmental hammer.  I liked it so much that I ordered five copies to give away to searching friends. <br />Basically, a lite read as well.  And the author has much the same gift that Rick Warren shows in \\"Purpose Driven Life\\", in that he takes complicated principles and simplifies them down to easy-to-understand truths without any dilution of meaning.  You'll love it, whether you are a Christian (any denomination) or not.	2005-10-13

While balanced perspectives are available to those proficient enough to wade through the stormy seas of coverage, much of the reporting obsesses on the drawbacks and any failed efforts of the US military and its allies.  <br /> It is a very good thing that such myriad media did not exist in 1776.  In David McCullough's engaging rendering of America's birth, he exposes the many setbacks, missteps, defeats, desertions, and poorly planned or executed campaigns that plagued the nascent nation's ragged army. Had CNN existed in those days, a colonial version of Judy Woodruff could regularly regale viewers with leading statements such as \\"more and more of General Washington's supporters are growing disillusioned with his poor management and indeciveness.\\"   An 18th century Al Franken could have gone on Air America (a.k.a. Err America) and maligned the American military for declaring war on a sovereign country that posed it no threat.  And an equally vacuous, previous incarnation of Arianna Huffington would have had reason to have elite loyalists malign Washington and company on a reality-blurring blog had such technology been around during the Revolution. <br /> McCullough does document the miscalculations America's inexperienced military committed as well as list the many triumphs of the established and potent British forces.  He expounds upon the doubts many of Washington's contemporaries privately and sometimes publicly expressed.  Before the sober judgment of history could objectively evaluate the transfiguring legacy of Washington's accomplishments, the uncertainty of the present did give jusifiable cause to those who questioned his wisdom and strategy.   The eventual success of the ragtag colonial army-despite massive desertions-and the enduring American experiment prove the mastery of Washington's prowess and show why his name has become synonymous with greatness. The Father of his Country would not have earned his rightful place in history had he failed to remain steadfast when the going got tough or adroitly recovered from the inevitable mistakes that befall all battlefield planning. <br /> \\"1776\\" fleshes out a timeless story and shows that there were many difficulties and heartaches that preceded the ultimate victory.  It also serves as a good inspiration for the ongoing liberation of Iraq.  Had the clichs of \\"quagmire\\" and \\"another Vietnam\\" existed in the 1700's no doubt the ancestors of today's antiwar ilk would have routinely invoked them.  As this readable work clearly spells out, war is a messy proposition where the best laid plans can and do go astray, but setbacks can never excuse retreat.  A far stronger case could have been made for abandoning the mission in 1776 than modern day Iraq.  Years from now both will stand as American military victories, and the bumps along the road to success will be reduced to historic footnotes.  <br />	2005-10-13

US	16428084	R2I1PFHWFEMTXC	1586482149	199148274	The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, and Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient	Books	5	10	15	N	N	Intriguing and Persuasive	This is a highly perceptive book that will get you thinking about East and West in a differnt way. Cultural clashes of today, as Sherdan Prasso shows us, were built on long-held stereotypes that get tweaked in new ways every generation.     A century ago, the dowager empress of China, already in her 70s, was portrayed in the West as an evil manipulator who killed off her rivals with poison cakes and indulged her sexual obsessions with a stable of male courtiers in the Forbidden City while the empire around her teetered at the edge of collapse. Tzu-hsi died in 1908, and the imperial system fell three years later. She certainly took part in perpetuating an out-dated regime. And with court politics quite secret, historians still debate whether she had a hand in the mysterious deaths of other contenders for China's throne, including her own son. Yet the wild stories printed in Western newspapers and books about Tzu-hsi were preposterous. And eagerly swallowed. When a British scholar later wrote of her unusual anatomy and bizarre sexual practices in repeated encounters with him - he was 29, she was 67 - his book was a sensation in Britain, widely accepted as proof that a true Dragon Lady had lived and breathed in the Orient. Not until 1974 was the book exposed as a hoax.     The cultural divide between East and West is so vast, even in these days of easy travel and instant access, that people on either side often want to believe remarkably inaccurate notions about those on the other. The dowager empress' story was one instance, but current ones abound in books and movies, and particularly in the minds of Western men who pursue Asian women, writes Sheridan Prasso in this book, a compelling study of Occidental misperceptions about Asia. \\"Mystery and sex, fear, and desire,\\" writes Prasso, a former Asia editor for Business Week. \\"The `Orient' has always meant lands far away, full of opulence and sensuality, danger, depravity, and opportunity.\\" Prasso argues persuasively thatWestern misunderstanding of Asia is routinely based on fantasy, positive or negative. There are consequences in diplomacy and business, but most of all in personal relations, particularly for Western men afflicted with what she calls \\"yellow fever,\\" the idealization of Asian women as feminine, attentive and seductive. Dragon ladies may exist, but sex goddesses abound.     If \\"The Asian Mystique\\" is not as literary as the 1978 classic \\"Orientalism,\\" Edward Said's masterful study of Western attitudes toward the East, it is a contemporary update on the same phenomenon: how Westerners project their hopes and fears onto whatever Asian culture they examine. A journalist who spent 15 years writing about Asia, Prasso is realistic about the dynamics of power and sensitive to the vagaries of culture and sex. Her energetic reporting and her depth of experience in Asia enables her to identify the superficial cultural practices that generate misperceptions, like politeness and self-denial in early encounters, and letting true feelings emerge over time.     At a girlie bar in Bangkok, Prasso surveys white male customers who are riveted to the supple flesh on delicate Asian bodies and drawn in by a cultural dynamic that they seem unaware of. \\"It is an easy purchase, this experience of Asia that is fantasy-indulging and, ultimately, `re-masculating' - engendering feelings of masculinity and dominance which these Western men may have found diminished in their own cultures.\\"      Prasso's book is split in two. One half analyzes the misperceptions that Westerners have about Asia. The other offers portraits of Asian women without mystique: housewives in Japan, bargirls in the Philippines, flight attendants on Cathay Pacific, college students in China. With her skill at getting women to talk about deeply personal issues, the author reveals them as human beings, prone to the same frailties, resilience and misconceptions as people anywhere. Prasso seizes on \\"Madame Butterfly\\" as the archetypal story of Western notions about the Asia mystique: a delicate Japanese woman with undying love for a dashing American naval officer. It's the loyal, self-sacrificing Asian beauty who is betrayed by a fickle Westerner, a story theatrically replayed in \\"Miss Saigon\\" and thoughtfully dissected in \\"M Butterfly.\\" Prasso is less persuasive when she argues that Hollywood has been the \\"incubator and firing kiln\\" of misperceptions about Asia. She documents Asian movie roles through the decades, a catalogue of racist stereotyping that makes for amusing reading but feels overblown. Were movie producers really responsible for the Western misreading of Asia? Or, more likely, simply eager to make money from prejudice that already existed? Prasso's personal experience is also missing. Having lived in Cambodia, Hong Kong and Japan as a single, white female, she acknowledges being part of a group sometimes \\"guilty of racist sour-grapeism,\\" of feeling overlooked and betrayed by Western men who are chasing Asian women. Yet she never lets on about her own attractions, or lack of them, to Asians. Reading her long accounts of the sexual adventures of others, one wonders about her own impressions in this arena.     In the end, looking at a deeply foreign culture is like looking at the future - its brings out our hopes and our fears, and we imagine scenarios on either extreme. Yet the reality that eventually unfolds is inevitably more muddled, more human - and more interesting - than one ever imagines.	2005-10-13

Tess, is skillful, beautiful and has pulled herself into a secret success story, only if Trace could understand her and what she has had to live with, but then you cannot convince someone to understand you, when they are so consumed with themselves and looking down at you. Now, Tess actually could have her own book, especially if you think about Vincent, he could be the perfect partner, in every aspect of her life, ooooooh that would be a great story line, a business partner and a personal partner, when a man is skillful personally and professionally and has the looks and body to make you loose your mind, umh whata man whata man, whata man!  Nikki, Nikki, street savvy, beautiful, skillful with her hands, has a skill that most women don't even dream of, making her a true asset in the world of Men, but too much of TRUST, shows to be life changing.  Kim, o Kim did he get his or did she get hers or did you get yours?? Kim is successful, beautiful and has a secret, and trying to keep it all in tact, shows to be disappointing, never thinking that Troy would do what he is doing, and then Stephanie reacts also, who do you run too....did you ever think about Malcolm?

To be frank, the minute I heard the premise of this book I knew that I would love it.  Author Frank Cottrell Boyce could have filled the pages of \\"Millions\\" with an unbroken stream of consciousness (appropriate for young readers, of course) and I STILL would have thought this book bloody marvelous.  As it happens, \\"Millions\\" is well-written in spite of my unrepentant love.  Sure it has its ups and downs and there is one plot element that doesn't make a lick of sense, but on the whole Boyce has come up with something truly smart and funny here.  As its hero Damian would say, \\"Quality\\".<br /><br />What would you do if you found 229,370 in cash?  If it just came falling out of the sky and into your lap, what would you do?  If you're like Damian, you've a moral dilemma on your hands.  Do you give the money to the poor or do you dig wells in Africa?  If you're Damian's older brother Anthony then you're trying to decide whether or invest in real estate or just buy a house upfront.  This may all sound like idle speculation, but for Damian and Anthony it's a problem they have to face right now!  You see, our story takes place mere days before England is just about to make the change from a pound based system to that of the new Euro.  That means that the money that came flying at Damian in a duffle bag thrown from a train has to be spent as quickly as possible before it becomes worthless.  Damian's goals tend to be goodhearted, partly because he's obsessed with saints and sainthood.  Anthony, however, is more inclined to want to spend the pounds on making more dough.  He's a businessman at heart.  Whatever their intentions, though, it soon becomes clear that having a lot of money is more difficult that either of them could have anticipated.  Especially when the people who threw it from the train in the first place want it back....<br /><br />Boyce's book is one of the rare children's novels that never hit it big in America but that still got made into a movie.  The book has a particularly contemporary feel to it.  The gadgets and games mentioned in it (such as plasma televisions) on first glance may date the novel in several years' time.  However, when you consider that this is basically a period piece anyway (it takes place at a very particular moment in history) then such excesses are more than justified.  Also, Damian constantly mentions a website that you should check out if you get a chance.  I wasn't personally able to figure out the games on that site, but it's still worth a chuckle.  Where else could you send a friend a saint's ear?<br /><br />The magical realism in \\"Millions\\" (Damian is visited frequently by saints of all types) works well within the story.  It rarely jars or falls flat.  The sole exception to this, to my mind, was the last visitation Damian receives.  I don't want to give anything away, but the moment is unnecessary and reminded me a bit more of that awful movie \\"Casper\\" than I would have liked.  Another problem with the book comes in the form of the character of Dorothy.  A potential girlfriend to the boys' father, she switches back and forth between good and bad without any logic.  One moment Damian's having visions of her on a train and the next she's waltzing into the house, clearly not on a train.  It's not only confusing, but downright weird and done without much in the way of explanation.<br /><br />Still, the book's a gem.  It's hard to create a likable character like Damian who is so very very good without turning him into an annoying freak of some kind.  It is exceedingly easy to write a mean or nasty character.  To write a good one can be an excessive challenge.  Damian, however, is perfect the way he is.  You never resent him and you're always on his side.  \\"Millions\\" also shows the evils of money as clearly as possible.  Consider pairing this with \\"The Toothpaste Millionaire\\" by Jean Merrill for some alternating views of children and excessive wealth.  Just make sure you read this book first.  Though I was pretty certain that I'd love it right from the start, it's probably got more fans out there than anyone could suspect.  Incredibly fun.\\" by Jean Merrill for some alternating views of children and excessive wealth.  Just make sure you read this book first.

Mr. Badger's Birthday Pie contains many repetitive elements, such as \\"you run in front, I'll run behind\\" and \\"but the fox ran faster\\".  The pattern builds and builds until the greedy fox is tripped up by Great Uncle Ram.  The story is a good one for retelling but I have to say that even I am confused by the ending.  It's supposed to provide a satisfying conclusion, but it really doesn't make sense.  If there were two pies all along, why did Miss Poppy go to such extremes to chase the fox?  And, yes, it's a happy ending but a child that's too young will be surprised that they're all eating pie when we clearly saw it smashed... This book works best for 2-3 year olds.  Anyone older will get hung up on this mysterious second pie, not mentioned until the end.  Where was the other one set to cool?  She is described as making \\"the\\" pie and setting it to cool, not \\"a\\" pie.  So, I guess if you're picky (like me) you could use it in unit about indefinite and definite articles.      By the way, you can also use this book with older children to introduce recipes using plants we now consider weeds.

It is well written and easy to follow, however, given that career development is a hard sell to management, implementation needs to include evaluation of the program as well.  Without showing the benefits of the program to management, career development within an organization will be seen as nothing more than a generous perk.  Many organizations pay for employees undergraduate and/or graduate education - and that often is a generous perk.  But organizations do see that while the employee is still there in the organization, the training and knowledge gained from the education is benefitting the organization.  The same needs to be said about career development.  Knowdell does not provide a lot of how this can help organizations, other than perhaps as a motivation tool for employees.  If you need that info, you'll need to do extra work to look at what research says in that area.  Overall, career development and tuition reimbursements do attract the best candidates to an organization, are developed within the organization, and are retained because they feel valued by the organization.	2005-10-13

This book is written in a conversational tone that draws you in and invites you to look from the physician's perspective at a case that clearly touched his heart. <br />This is  a compelling book that I will read again.	2005-10-13

If your class uses this book, prepare to go to class. All the time. That's because if you fall behind, the book does not do a good job of explaining things to you. Examples are generally vague and only apply to a few types of problems provided at the back of each section. A lot of the time, I'd find myself stumped on a problem, looking back, and realizing there was no example problem for me to get ideas from. <br /> <br />Yes there are lots of problems and that's good, in a way. But what's the point of having all those problems if the book never teaches you how to do them? <br /> <br />Furthermore, it is a poorly written book. Generally, reading through the book is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Literally speaking. You spend all that time figuring out what the authors talk about and once you figure it out, it was not even worth all that time. <br /> <br />So go to class. All the time. If the prof isnt that great, get yourself another workbook. I havent seen Schaum's but I'm pretty sure they'll do a better job on covering the topics than this text does.	2005-10-13

I think he does the public a service by making it so easy to read. Unfortunately, this accessibility is largely gained at the expense of a certain philosophical elegance, if you will. For example, in some contexts he'll use the word \\"universe\\" as meaning physical spacetime, and in other contexts he'll use it to mean \\"everything that exists, including God.\\" Initially, he tells you when he's changing his meaning, but then he later doesn't.<br /><br />In short, if you are used to the clarity and rigorous approach used by many philosophical authors (e.g., Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, etc.), then you may find Ward's approach a bit less deductive (or even inductive). He is mostly concerned with rebutting Dawkins and Atkins than actually developing an original philosophy.<br /><br />For instance, he develops many interesting metaphysical ideas (for example, human free will is not incompatible with God's omniscience, since God could conceivably know of every *possible universe* while the future of the *actual universe* was indetermined), but he doesn't lay down a rigorous metaphysical system. I suppose one reason he does this is because he wants to appeal to a wide crowd of religious people who have their own doctrines, and they might feel alienated if Ward was to make truth claims beyond what is universally accepted about how the universe works.<br /><br />Not clearly a good thing, he often waxes lyrical in poetic tangents that don't do much to help his case, except maybe emotionally or aesthetically. Though, I suppose if intuition and aesthetics are any basis for concluding something about reality, then these tangents aren't entirely wasteful. Oh, and for some reason he frequently employs awkward transitional adverbs to begin sentences like, \\"In fact, of course, it is true that...,\\" which I found distracting.<br /><br />I think this book's greatest success is in highlighting the grave limitations of natural selection *alone* to explain intelligent life. He effectively proves that the idea of life existing for the propagation of genes (Cf. Dawkins, \\"The Selfish Gene\\") is completely ludicrous (it would be, he points out, like suggesting that the cake exists for the propagation of the recipe; but the recipe does not have intention, and neither does DNA!). Again, these are not couched in philosophical language, and, if you want a more rigorous approach that supports Ward's position, I recommend you see any of John Searle's essays or books about consciousness.ighlighting the grave limitations of natural selection *alone* to explain intelligent life.

Told cleverly in flashback, The Long-Range Plan is a gripping story of the anti-hero who wants it all, deserves none of it, winds up with half of it, suspects it is the wrong half, but can never go back to find out.  <br />To say more in that vein would spoil the novel's delicious suspense, but be forewarned that the plot revolves around a love story and a caper that will keep you turning pages long past your bedtime.    <br />As the curtain rises, the anti-hero, Cole Archer, is a first-year high school teacher in Charleston, S.C., who will soon fall in love with one of his students, Savannah Bellington, a bright, fetching, ambitious girl, 16, from the wrong side of a wealthy school district, a trailer park. From the day they meet, the stage is set for tragedy, but our protagonist, now 26, has been rehearsing for it a long time. Since the high-water mark of his young life--graduating from college with honors--he has been in a downward spiral of wasted days and wasted nights fueled by prodigious drinking and promiscuous sex.  <br />The latest consequence of that lifestyle, being dumped by a fianc who wants a sober, faithful husband, not a boozing philanderer, has brought Archer to a new low--but to no new understanding of himself. Otherwise as smart as they come, he somehow missed out on the cause-and-effect connection between behavior and consequences, and goes right on making the same mistakes, mainly because he lacks a moral rudder. This is his fatal flaw. Fully aware, for instance, that a student-teacher affair in high school is The Big No-No, he does it anyhow. After all, self-indulgence is his speed, and the sooner, the better in all things. A frustrated writer, he hates the nine-to-five world and, though an excellent teacher, he despises the bureaucratic sinkhole that his school district has become. So when he sees a chance to take the money and run, well, what else could an anti-hero do? Indeed, quoted right up front in the novel is the maxim: \\"Never underestimate the power of cash.\\" <br />Archer does have redeeming qualities. He loves his cat, Brasco; he sympathizes with the weak; he's loyal to friends; he's grateful for favors; and he's squeamish about causing injury to others. Not squeamish enough not to do it, but squeamish nonetheless. But his chief redeeming quality is that we couldn't have this kind of story without this kind of character: a twenty-something man born to middle-class privilege in the Land of Opportunity who still can't win for losing--and has no idea why. The Long-Range Plan is a moral fable for modern times and is by a writer that readers are going to hear from a whole lot more.	2005-10-13

Hippolyte, who refuses to welcome any 20th century luxury, is obsessed with finding a set of islands with a dark, muddled history. The first part of the book focuses on his search for the islands. <br /> <br />His adventures are funded by a publisher taking a chance, and are later to be reviewed by a straight-laced editor without any sympathy towards Hippolyte's shortcomings.  The second half of the book focuses on proving the first half of the book was real.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book suffers from an inconsistent voice.  Even Hippolyte changes from an obsessive compulsive man capapble of managing his life as an adult to an erratic, boy-like bohemian dead set on writing a story about... his under-developed adventure. <br /> <br />As a result, we learn that while Hippolyte is an excellent adventurer, he is a horrible writer.  And the second half of the book makes the reader put up with Hippolyte's disrespect of anything normal.  If Hippolyte wasn't so darn strange, none of the problems encountered after his trip would have surfaced, and you can't help but want to reach in and slap him sometimes. I found reading through the various documents - letters, emails, chapters by Hippolyte himself - to be tedious and unrewarding.   <br /> <br />The end of the book does a pretty nice job of wrapping up the story, and the aftertaste of the book sits nice on the bookshelf.  Unfortunately, there is a great sense of \\"so what\\" throughout the book, as the reader has to wait for the nice bits of Hodgson's writing to surface.   <br /> <br />Filled with magical moments of beautiful prose, and unforunate insertions of ugly facts, the book is fighting with itself to either be a historical document or a rich novel.  If you are looking for a quirky mix of fact and fiction - this is it.	2005-10-13

US	42919136	R3U42FK0IF5JH2	0766024644	595028133	Colin Powell: Have A Vision- Be Demanding (African-American Biography Library)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Colin Powell - A Career in Public Service	As a teacher, I like the way this biography begins with Colin Powell's crowning achievement, becoming the Secretary of State under President George W. Bush.  The author then flashes back to Colin Powell's childhood and we get to read how he made it to this very important position in our country. <br /> <br />This is an inspiring story of a son born to immigrant parents who came to the United States seeking a better life.  Education was important in his family and Colin Powell entered City College in New York City as an engineering major.  It was through trying different courses (ROTC) that Colin Powell found his calling. <br /> <br />There are certain features of this book that I really like.  Ms. Shichtman has these side boxes (colored in a deep yellow) that give historical background information of what was happening in the world at different times in Colin Powell's life.  With these boxes the reader can then understand the influence of Segregation, the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War, etc. had on Mr. Powell's life and his achievements.   The author also has green boxes that contain quotes from Colin Powell that help define his life.  The photographs were of Mr. Powell at various points of his life and there are also photographs of historical interest.  The Chronology of Colin Powell's life at the back of the book gives a nice summary of his life. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book not only for young people studying about famous African Americans, but anyone wanting to learn about famous Americans. <br />	2005-10-13

How was I disappointed?  Let me count the <br />ways: <br /> <br />(*) The writing is utterly sophomoric and amateurish.  PLEASE read a chapter or two before buying. <br />Most unpublished fan fiction is better than this.  The dialogue is inept in the extreme.  It truly <br />reads like a high school junior's attempt to write fiction - very overwritten, with characters <br />overacting. <br /> <br />(*) It is SLOW AND BORING.  I almost fell asleep several times.  At one point a character phones <br />a couple people to check where someone is...each phone call is tediously described, when a simple <br />\\"Harry's parents hadn't seen him either\\" would have sufficed.  This is only one example.  Really, <br />there is not much that happens in the book, there is no tension, and there is nothing that makes <br />you want to turn the page.  Even my extreme love for the Voyager characters made it tough slogging. <br /> <br />(*) The story is ridiculously unbelievable and hackneyed.  Star Fleet goes fascist again due to some  <br />overly militaristic officers.  Yawn.  Never seen that one before.  The low point is when news of the  <br />Borg plague hits and Icheb is beaten by his Starfleet classmates...it's so unbelievable that they're <br />his pals one moment and pummeling him the next.  (By the way, don't get excited by the phrase \\"Borg <br />plague\\" - it's only mentioned in passing.  Presumably the second volume covers it). <br /> <br />All in all, this is easily the worst Star Trek novel I've ever read.  Christie Golden had a fantastic <br />opportunity and setting - what happened to Voyager's crew after they returned? - and utterly  <br />squandered it with this dull, amateurish offering.  I certainly won't be buying thesecond book, <br />and I'd feel guilty selling the first one to a fellow human being. <br />	2005-10-13

Eccentricity was often simply the Ordinary carried to a high degree of pictorial perfection, Sitwell claims, and thus we get a gifted glimpse of the usually-overlooked obvious.<br /><br />Of course, there is so much material to work with, it is a wonder the book isn't multi-volumed! Originally published in 1933, it retains much of its vitality and levity despite being two generations (at least) behind the times. Sitwell caught the character of the English Eccentric at a time just before the wholesale decline of Empire, and thus the character portrayed here is a 'standard' one.<br /><br />'Eccentricity exists particularly in the English, and partly, I think, because of that peculiar and satisfactory knowledge of infallibility that is the hallmark and birthright of the British nation.'<br /><br />In the relating of small tales and glimpses of life, Sitwell takes us through a history of language usage and abusage, cultural niceties gone awry, personal proclivities taken to extremes, historical remembrances remembered a bit incorrectly, all the while maintaining a strong British 'we know just what we're doing, thank you, and we're doing it quite correctly' attitude.<br /><br />We find hermits, both ancient and ornamental (the distinction between the two of course being a relative flash that one would think inimical to the hermit-age); quacks and alchemists, some members of the sporting set (we learn of one who, in an attempt to scare the hiccups out of himself, set fire to his nightshirt--of course he was still in it--and was satisfied despite the burns that his hiccups had been vanquished), various other sorts and sets in the land.<br /><br />Perhaps the most valuable lesson to be learned from this book would the Of the Benefits of Posthumous Fame. Using Milton as the first example, Sitwell proceeds to demonstrate just how this posthumous fame (for the man who sold Paradise Lost for the meagre sum of £20) can be a great boon to all concerned, particularly those who have the foresight to collect locks of hair or write poetry about rummaging through the bone-remains of the dead poet. Of course, there followed in short order a detailed (yet anonymous) description of why the poet could not have actually handled the bones of the poet, not least of which being that as the grave said 1653, and Milton was not in fact buried until 1674, et cetera; thus begins an active correspondence of attempting to prove or disprove in fashion why Milton was not bodily handled.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly English treatment; like her eccentrics, Sitwell's style of writing is likewise gloriously eccentric. Much will be missed on the first reading, and again the second; by the third reading (should you be so eccentric as to persevere through to such) you will either be so charmed by the writing that you will carry this book around, quoting passages that need context to be understood (and thus be ordained into a minor order of eccentricity yourself) or, you will give the book away to the most tedious of your friends, hoping that the friend will take the hint.<br /><br />The choice is yours.emonstrate just how this posthumous fame (for the man who sold Paradise Lost for the meagre sum of 20) can be a great boon to all concerned, particularly those who have the foresight to collect locks of hair or write poetry about rummaging through the bone-remains of the dead poet.

The writing in the book is done well, and leaves a certain amount of mystery that leaves you wanting to read on about Roland of Gilead, the gunslinger himself. Unfortunately, the vague past given about Roland can leave people confused or just make them loose interest. The first book is slightly different from the later books, but it is interesting in its own ways. The little links to our world definately add to the story, making you really think about the world you're reading about. This book is definately worth reading, but be prepared to have the urge to read the rest of the sprawling series.	2005-10-13

See, this is due to the fact that Count Leo had at least two phases in his brilliant career as a writer. In the most important one, he revealed himself as a master craftsman of the Verbe, an acute and profound vivisector of the human soul, like in \\"Anna Karenina\\", \\"War and Peace\\", \\"Hadji Murad\\" and his best tales. In a late phase, Tolstoy transformed himself into a preacher, a proponent of rural lifestyles -which is fine if it does not contain the condemnation of other lifestyles. Even worse, he turned into a moralist, preaching to the world the way everybody should conduct their affairs, and into a moral celebrity.  <br /> <br />Bat anyway some of his tales are really good, including \\"Ivan the  Fool\\", which nonetheless lets the reader see very clearly the cheap philosophy behind it. In my opinion, the best tales in this collection are \\"Polikushka\\", a masterpiece of crude and rude Naturalism, vivid and sad; \\"Albert the Musician\\", a sadness of alcoholic delirium-tremens; \\"Forty years\\", the story of Divine punishment; and \\"The Three Questions\\", about moral learning. <br /> <br />The strange characteristics of Russian literature shine through in this volume: mysticism, spiritual torment, poverty and harsh weather abound in the work of this great author.	2005-10-13

I would have no objection to the the Kerry fans posting here if they at least provided an articulate review or comment. What I see here, is just condescending sarcasm, we hate Bush, don't y ou dare write or say anything against John Kerry (even if it is true) and take cheap shots at the five star reviews, making racial wise cracks and even taking cheap shots at certain religious groups like the catholics mispelling their denomination as Cathy_Licks and other such nonsense. <br /> <br />All I have read by the five star reviewers is exactly what is in the book. Obviously plenty of people are shocked at Sen. Kerry's background and justifiably so. Also apparent is that the Kerry camp wants to block this information, act like it never existed. Last year at this time, the Kerry people tried to keep Unfit For Command from being sold anywhere including here at Amazon.com. Now they are acting like the book either is no longer around or is gone and are making wise cracks to anyone who has bought the book recently and dares to write a review posting their feelings. <br /> <br /> <br />So I ask, what is the Kerry camp afraid of? What are the democrats afraid of? If in fact this book is incorrect, all Kerry has to do is come forward and tell the facts. So far he hasn't.  <br /> <br />As an independent and analytical reader, I always judge a book like this with so many charges by it's references. I was happy to see that the authors have 6 pages of references backing up the data in this book.  <br /> <br />If you are an independent reader, please read Unfit For Command and judge for yourself. And Kerry fans, if you have any creditable information that anything in this  book is wrong, please provide it, but not just a statement, a link or a reputable source. Something other than a Kerry fan's website or a link from amessage board or chat room. In other words, put up or shut up. <br /> <br />In another regard, when you look at the reviews and their handles like Wedgie, I guess thattells a lot about the character and personality of the people that support a man like Kerry doesn't it? (SAY YES---IT'S OBVIOUS) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

I have read several of this author's books and they are extremely well-written. This book is definitely no exception. Although, as can be expected, the author focuses on witches and witch hunts mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there is a chapter covering the mid-twentieth century Nazi period. As usual, the writing is clear, engaging, breathlessly exciting in places and occasionally tongue-in-cheek in the way certain things and events are described. This makes this masterpiece very difficult to put down. The descriptions given of the methods used to torture supposed witches, and their effects on the human body, are very graphic; so, no punches are pulled, as it were.

Kirkpatrick, former Ambassador to the United Nations under Ronald Reagan, is the author of one of the three most famous essays in the history of American foreign policy, \\"Dictatorships and Double Standards,\\" Commentary (November 1979)--the other two being George F. Kennan's call for \\"containment\\" of the Soviet Union and The End of History by Francis Fukuyama.  In it she argued that it was incumbent on the United States to differentiate between authoritarian regimes and totalitarian regimes.  Authoritarian regimes she argued, like Iran and Nicaragua, though they obviously did not meet our preferred standards of democratization, were fundamentally just harsh, but traditional, governments of countries which had known no other type of government and were perhaps not yet ready for democracy :<br /><br />  \\"Traditional autocrats leave in place existing allocations of wealth, power, status, and other<br /><br />  resources, which in most traditional societies favor an affluent few and maintain masses in poverty.<br /><br />  But they worship traditional gods and observe traditional taboos.  They do not disturb the habitual<br /><br />  rhythms of work and leisure, habitual places of residence, habitual patterns of family and personal<br /><br />  relations.\\"<br /><br />Essentially, the autocracies protect their own power and wealth, but leave most other aspects of life relatively untouched.  As the name implies, they are more concerned with who in society will wield authority, i.e. themselves, than with imposing any particular ideology.  Because this is the case, they in fact preserve many of the institutions upon which democracy can later be built, whether the Church or corporations or other civic organizations.<br /><br />Totalitarian regimes, on the other hand, as the name implies, seek to totally reinvent and control every aspect of society.  This requires them to so violate the existing institutions as to render the society nearly incapable of evolving into a democracy.<br /><br />These fundamental differences between the two types of regimes suggest important reasons that we should be more rigorous in our approach to the one than the other.  Because authoritarian regimes are less oppressive of their citizens and are more amenable to democracy they are more susceptible to pressure from without, but at the same time, particularly when Kirkpatrick was writing, at the very nadir of the Cold War, it was especially dangerous to destabilize these generally friendly regimes, particularly in light of the fact that they could be expected, over a period of years, to gradually transform themselves into more democratic societies.<br /><br />Meanwhile, authoritarian regimes, like Cuba and Vietnam, though they tend to cast their ideology in the language of progressive democracy, which makes them seem somehow more akin to the U.S., in reality are much more oppressive of their people and, because they destroy traditional institutions, tend to create such devastation that it is extremely difficult for external pressure to aid the rise of democracy.  They are both worse for their people in the short run and more likely to endure in the long run.<br /><br />This leaves America in a difficult position.  Neither type of government vindicates our ideals of liberal democracy.  We would of course like to see both become more democratic.  But the regimes we can most easily change are the less offensive ones, and ones that are likely to be our de facto allies.  Those regimes which truly brutalize their populations, and which at that time were generally allied with our enemy, the Soviet Union, tend not to be easily pressured.<br /><br />Further complicating matters is the fact that in countries with authoritarian regimes, there tend to be reasonably well-organized and very well supplied guerrilla movements.  This was particularly true when the Soviet Union and the rest of the Warsaw Pact nations existed and stood ready to support them.  Totalitarian nations, with their much more restrictive internal controls, and with the U.S. showing no interest in supplying indigenous rebellions, tended to be relatively free of organized civil unrest.<br /><br />All of these factors combined in the late 1970's to bring about the bizarre and tragic situation whereby the government of Jimmy Carter basically helped to topple the Somoza government in Nicaragua and the Shah in Iran.  In effect, this eliminated two friendly governments in important strategic locations, governments which while by no means ideal were hardly the two worst human rights offenders even in their own regions.  In the ultimate perversity, it seemed that they were actually targeted by the Carter Administration precisely because they were so closely associated with the United States.  Allies were destroyed, an action made possible because they were not as repressive as other regimes, and replaced by radical totalitarian regimes allied with the Soviet Union, with whom we were at war.<br /><br />Looked at in the abstract like this, the Carter policy seems nearly suicidal.  But Jeane Kirkpatrick traced it to a dangerous faith in Rationalism, as opposed to reliance on Realism, as the basis of foreign policy.  The important thing to note here is that the critique of Rationalism that she offers is very similar to the general conservative critique of modern day liberalism.  The Left has an almost alchemical notion of mankind, believing that any transmutation that they can arrive at rationally can be then be engineered socially.  Able to imagine a utopian world in which Marxist guerilla leaders turn a illiterate, Third World, agrarian, nation into a liberal, egalitarian democracy (moreover, one that would be unfettered by such hoary institutions as the Church, the aristocracy, the military, etc.), they assume such an apotheosis to be imminent.<br /><br />What Kirkpatrick was calling for was a foreign policy grounded in Realism.  Hard experience has demonstrated time and again that revolutionaries who set out to completely transform a society end up imposing an even greater tyranny than the one they replace.  Even more troublesome, they practically never fade away or evolve into democracies (at least they hadn't to that point--the collapse of Eastern European Communism offers a difficult counter argument), they are likely to endure until they in turn are overthrown by conquest from without or violent counterrevolution from within.  For these reasons, we are frequently, if not always, better off opting for the devil we know, the kind of traditional autocratic regimes which, though not democratic, at least offer stability and domestic order, tend to be fairly trustworthy allies, and frequently evolve into democracies.  Kirkpatrick's theory was ultimately vindicated at least in this regard as this was basically the process which occurred in places like Spain, the Philippines, South Africa, Chile, and so on.<br /><br />In fact, the current case of Russia provides a really difficult test of some the implications of theory.  The complete failure of capitalism and democratic institutions to establish themselves in post-Soviet Russia begs the question of whether a brief period of fascist rule there might not have a salutary effect.  First, it would allow central authorities to reestablish the rule of law, both by curbing crime and corruption and by restoring the notion of property rights.  This sort of functioning legal system it now seems fair to say  is an absolutely imperative precursor of capitalism and democracy.  Second, it would provide a period of relative physical security and cultural freedom during which civic institutions could be revitalized--the Church, political parties, corporations, the military, law enforcement, the judiciary, etc.  Difficult as the prospect may be for us to accept, it may well be the case that a healthy Russian democracy will only flower in the wake of a period of authoritarian rule.  This is notto suggest that we should aid Vladimir Putin in oppressing his own people or even that we should turn a blind eye, it is merely to suggest that it might be in our own best interests and ultimately those of the Russian people to allow him some latitude to restore order to that badly disordered nation, even if in so doing he sometimes offends our delicate democratic sensibilities.<br /><br />Other essays in this collection range over a surprisingly wide field, including some perceptive observations on American domestic politics.  The span of years and topics covered means that they don't necessarily fit together into a unified whole, but the dichotomy between reason and realism recurs often enough that they do present a coherent argument in the end.  Thus, in an essay on the failure of the efforts to reform the political parties, she's essentially arguing that the reformers bought into an illusion that they could make the parties adhere to abstract principles, simply because they could imagine this happening.<br /><br />Similarly, in discussing the failure of the New Right to capture either the presidency or the Republican Party nomination in 1976, as theorists like Kevin Phillips, Pat Buchanan, William Rusher, and others expected they would, she points out that their theories were based on a faith that would have required a genuine transformation in the American electorate.  This faith, as the only incremental successes of even Ronald Reagan and the Republican Congress of '94 have demonstrated, was rather misguided.  It may be true--I hope to God it is--that people are reasonably conservative at their core, but it is surely no coincidence that for the past seventy years they have consistently elected candidates who have promised them ever greater government benefits.  While reason can build a case for why that should, even why it must, change, realism requires one to note the stubborn fact.<br /><br />Today these essays are probably little more than a footnote to the history of the Cold War.  But they among the more interesting footnotes.  The fact that Kirkpatrick became a major player in the administration the defeated Communism and won the Cold War, the degree to which her ideas were turned into official U.

Eliot, and the decidedly un-Kerouacesqe \\"On the Sidewalk\\".  Another satirizes a Life Magazine article that had had some impact on the public psyche during the 1950's, but is virtually unknown today.  At least somewhat more amusing is \\"Drinking from a Cup Made Cinchy\\", a satire on books of golf tips, and \\"The Unread Book Route\\", which is less a parody than a Bombeck-style household confession.<br /><br />The \\"First Person Plural\\" section samples Updike's columns written for The New Yorker's \\"Talk of the Town\\" department, and as such is strong on style and in documenting a certain time and place, but its entertainment value is limited by the absence of plot.  Best of these is \\"Doomsday, Mass.\\" which deals with the simple fact of living under the threat of nuclear holocaust.  On a more upbeat note, \\"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu\\" describes the author's thoughts on seeing the last game played at Fenway Park by Ted Williams.  Maybe Updike is just an ordinary guy after all.<br /><br />\\"First Person Singular\\" features some painfully slow reminiscences on Updike's boyhood that by their very nature lack any real point or direction.  Perhaps the best of these is \\"The Lucid Eye in Silver Town\\", although once again, it assumes some personal connection to New York City which most readers simply won't share.<br /><br />To this reviewer, the standout section is the book reviews, but they aren't likely to be of much interest to the general reader.  The pieces on Thurber, Salinger, and Aiken are succinct and well-thought out, but what will readers derive from Updike's thoughts on such obscure metaphysical works as Karl Barth's \\"Anselm: Fides Quaerens Intellectum\\", Paul Tillich's \\"Morality and Beyond\\", or the \\"Letters of James Agee to Father Flye\\"?  These pieces seem included to establish the author's credentials as a serious intellectual, rather than because anyone was likely to want to read them.<br /><br />Perhaps it was only a young man's vanity that convinced the author this book was worth publishing at all.  But despite the Updike's obvious gift with prose, there's very little worthwhile in this hodgepodge.  Stick to fiction, John; always go with your strength.These pieces seem included to establish the author's credentials as a serious intellectual, rather than because anyone was likely to want to read them. <br /> <br />Perhaps it was only a young man's vanity that convinced the author this book was worth publishing at all.

Believe me, I love the thought of thousands of school-aged children standing in line at midnight to buy a book --- but I wasn't there. However, I gladly would have stood in line way past my bedtime to pick up a copy of THE COLORADO KID by Stephen King. What's not to love about a new King novel, a paperback original published by the newly indispensable Hard Case Crime imprint? <br /> <br />It turns out that the book was nothing like I had expected. It's not a hard-boiled detective novel --- no faces through the window, no sex beyond the sultry Glenn Orbik rendering on the cover, no gunshots, either on or off the page. What THE COLORADO KID is, however, is a finely rendered mystery with a gently philosophical touch that, incidentally, contains some of King's best writing. Yes, even this late in the day, The Man is still The Man. <br /> <br />So what can be expected from a reading of THE COLORADO KID? It is, at its essence, a discussion over coffee, kind of the New England equivalent of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, wherein the elderly editors of a weekly newspaper serving Moose-Lookit Island off the coast of Maine take an interning reporter to school with the account of a death occurring more than a quarter-century beforehand. The deceased was discovered on Moose-Lookit with no identification, though he later became known as the Colorado Kid; his death was apparently the result of choking on a piece of steak. But with the \\"how\\" solved, the questions raised in the minds of the newspapermen --- related to the journalistic w's --- remain. <br /> <br />THE COLORADO KID is the story of that investigation, told in retrospect. There is charm to the narrative, not the least of which is the result of King having a bit of fun with the reader. He very implicitly interjects himself into the narrative throughout the novel --- all I will say is that it is self-evident from the first page --- but this work is not a mere piece of whimsy. Some of King's best writing is contained in the very last paragraph of this fine work, but please don't skip ahead to read it. It is built entirely upon what has gone before, not only in THE COLORADO KID, but also in King's entire body of work. And for that alone, I would have stood in line at midnight. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub	2005-10-13

In this work, Ignatieff explores the idea of need and its consequences for how we think about the political and social organization of our societies.  Ignatieff's point of departure is the fact that the modern welfare states provide, as a matter of right, support for a few narrowly defined physical needs but that this leaves a large range of important needs untouched.  Satisfaction of these needs has left not only other important needs unsatisfied but has resulted in an erosion of social solidarity essential to certain aspects of needs.  Ignatieff sets out to explore historic conceptions of need and how they relate to influential political and economic theories.  Having defined the problem, Ignatieff proceeds to a series of interesting essays examining conceptions of need and various analyses of society.  These include a sensitive reading of King Lear as a study of natural versus social man, a relevant analysis of Augustine, and particularly good study of the implications of Hume's philosophy using Hume's death as it fulcrum, and a nice comparison of Adam Smith and Rousseau.  Ignatieff demonstrates that conceptions of need are variable, often contradictory, and that different conceptions have markedly different consdequences for how we think society should be organized.  These sections are insightful and Ignatieff is a very good and often eloquent writer.  The deficiency of this book is that having exposed these difficulties, Ignatieff makes no effort to show a way forward except to say that we need to develop a \\"language of needs.\\"  Presumably, this means some kind of common vocabulary that would allow us to address the problems of defining and addressing many human needs.  Aside from the ambiguity of his statements, he makes no effort to suggest how such a vocabulary could be constructed.  What kind of definitions could be used?  Is there a typology of needs possible?  Is there a hierarchy of needs?  How does this impact on thinking about organizing society.  These are difficult questions but having set the stage for addressing these issues, Ignatieff abruptly rings down the curtain.possible?  Is there a hierarchy of needs?

I purchased this book to brush up on speed training and the latest techniques so I could train my son and some soccer teamates.  I have done speed training myself years ago and was familiar with the methods.  This book cuts out the fluff and tells you exactly what to do and why. The author does a good job of explaining how to apply the training to younger athletes and at what age each technique is appropriate.  The step by step training course outlined is terrific.  My only complaint is that not enough emphasis is put on sprintng technique/posture and how to improve it.  My experience has been that poor technique/posture is often the biggest problem for young athletes and luckily I already knew quite a bit about technique. A few more photos and details on proper sprinting technique would really help.  Overall, the book is very good and we are achieving great results using the workouts.	2005-10-13

Smith is portrayed as a satyr with a decided taste for kinky sex. To be honest, it is a disgraceful portrayal of the man. I am no apologist for Smith, but his sins have to do with the way in which TITANIC was navigated and  NOT with what he allegedly did or did not do in the privacy of his cabi-- or anyone else's.  <br /> <br />Then there is the hack job done on J. Bruce Ismay --his family should definitely consider a day in court!I don't know if the guy was gay or not and I don't frankly care! There is plenty of interesting historical materiel about the man which could have been used to good effect in this novel rather than having him supposedly take advantage of a man who is not only drunk out of his skull but obviously distraught over some news which he has received. I know everyone seems to want to \\"diss\\" Ismay but this is really a bit much! <br /> <br />For the rest of it: two girls named Smoke and Swan? Did this woman have ANY idea of the age she is writing about? Trust me on this one, folks--a family as uppercrust as the Brockhursts would NOT be likely to give their daughters such names. There would also be little chance of musicians and nubile first class passengers dallying together, no matter how good a plot it might seem at first.  <br /> <br />The next time that Ms O'Cork undertakes to write a historical novel, I suggest that she undertakes research before writing it or it will end up as big a turkey as \\"Titanic--A Love Story\\". I rarely give novels a bad review as I actually enjoy reading good historical fiction. Unfortunately, I cannot include this book in that category. This book isn't worth the paper it is written on!	2005-10-13

The Thai-Lao settled in northeast Thailand where they ... developed their own distinct identity within the region that came to be called Isan.\\"    This quote, from the beginning of chapter 2, provides an epitome of this rigorous academic ethnographic study of the people of the Isan region, their Buddhism, their animism and magic, their society and culture. The book is not an easy read for the non-professional anthropologist, but nevertheless provides a wealth of detail on the Isan people that may be of general interest to those familiar with Thailand, Bangkok, or Laos. The author presents issues relevant to the study, provides a brief review of previous literature, gives a short history of ancient Lan Xang (Lan Chang) kingdom and its deterioration, and the emergence of the Lao Diaspora along the Mekong River. The bulk of the book details the often bizarre beliefs of the Isan people that result from Theravada Buddhism overlaying ancient animistic beliefs in spirits, witchcraft, and magic.    Aimed at the professional anthropologist and serious student of Thailand, Laos, and Theravada Buddhism; an excellent reference for that audience. Includes an extensive multilingual bibliography.    Hopefully the publisher will keep this title in print.	2005-10-13

(I started thinking that autor himself need to learn the language).

Also, in the most of the code examples suddenly there appear something new, something specific to C#, and autor even does not say a word about that. Because of that, since the autor has tendency to use  a long code, and on the other hand has a tendency to explain trough examples, this non-explanation  makes the book really impossible to understand, not reading several other books. <br />Who ever is thinking to buy this book please believe me, it is not the first book to read on C#.

Spending one's formative years in an old order Amish community is poor preparation for life in the outside world, and covering one's trail with lies is poor preparation for life in any world. Not even Will's wife Helen knows that her husband is not who he said he was, meaning that she and their children are not quite who she thinks they were, and that the man she has been sleeping with for years will turn out to be worse than a stranger; to her he's a cipher.  <br />Will begins to come clean with Helen and his own children when the urge to go home again brings him hope that he can heal the breach with a father who long ago disowned him-and who will prove slow, very slow, to forgive. There's also the little matter of still another secret in Will's past: He is the father of an illegitimate child he left behind who is now being raised by his sister as her own daughter.  <br />Underneath this main storyline for most of the book's pages is the minor theme of Will's troubles with his own sons, Welch and Riley, particularly Riley, who is every bit the rebel, and then some, that his father was in more innocent times. Will came of age in the1940s; Riley is the 1960s version of the rebel son: draft-dodging, drugs, anti-war slogans, and up-yours attitudes from the Youth Rebellion, Sexual Revolution, and various other socio-political movements that disdained anyone over 30, proclaimed the me-first philosophy of life, employed the in-your-face approach to discussion, and embraced the certitude that nobody born before 1950 could possibly know his elbow from third base. Riley is, of course, wrong on virtually all counts, but how he begins to get a clue is an affecting story that surfaces at just the right time as part of the book's major theme: in part, how the sins of the father are visited upon the son, but mostly how the generation gap challenges the bridge-building skills between parents and children alike. It is no coincidence here that Will, a blue-collar worker, builds bridges for a living.         <br />   Levi's Will is a solid follow-up to Bad Ground, Cramer's 2004 offering that was selected by Publishers Weekly as one of the best books of the year. It also finds Cramer demonstrating again that the Christian-fiction genre, his mtier, can easily cross over into mainstream fiction. The latest novel might not be the writing tour de force that Bad Ground was, but its command of story is much surer, and in fiction ultimately the story is of paramount importance.  <br />Speaking of \\"paramount,\\" this novel would make a very good movie.

Humankind is overwhelmed with chaos.  This story of an American warrior in love with a Sufi woman is a standout, thanks to William Hathaway's exceptional writing style.<br /><br />The harm we do others always comes back to us.  No one understands that cosmic law better than Jeff Madsen.  Madsen is a Vietnam era veteran still haunted by his experiences there.  His position as U.S. State Department Foreign Aid officer in Kyrgyzstan is playing politics and little else.  His marriage is in shambles.  His job is a balancing act, placating the Russian and Kyrgyz military while trying not to offend Muslim potentates.  When terrorists steal a weapon of mass destruction, Jeff's warrior instincts resurface.<br /><br />Cholpon is a Sufi sister in her mid thirties.  She lives in a remote mountainous area of Kyrgyzstan and has survived<br /><br />communism and Muslim mullahs who despise the Sufis.  For fifteen years she's learned to harness transcendental meditation and astral channeling to strengthen her chakras.  Cholpon meets her karma head on in the person of Jeff Madsen, who shows up on her doorstep bleeding from a terrorist attack nearby.  She soon becomes a loving spark of life to a heart Jeff thought was dead.<br /><br />Learning the Sufi way of harmony and peace transforms the warrior.  He understands such peaceful unterventions may be the only chance Earth has of surviving endless war.  When Cholpon and her gentle sisters locate the stolen atomic warhead, Jeff fears for their survival.  Will the Sufi's peaceful interventions or man's warring nature save millions from destruction?<br /><br />This touching love story is also a modern day adventure thriller that blends Sufi mystics, militant terrorists, metaphysical mysteries, and double dealing men of every nationality in surprising ways.  This is a true picture of the world we live in as it is, and as it could be if lasting love<br /><br />and peace were possible.and as it could be if lasting love  <br />and peace were possible.    <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Cheyfitz does not claim to share any revolutionary ideas with the reader; on the contrary, he asserts that the fundamental philosophy of business has not changed for centuries, only the methods and tools evolve. This conservative attitude is coupled with entertaining style. He draws examples both from his personal experience and from conscientiously researched literature.<br /><br />For beginners in business the book is a must. Veteran businesspeople should know most of Cheyfitz's rules from experience; still the book will probably provide some valuable insights for them, too.<br /><br />Detailed review:<br /><br />It is difficult to find a business book that is systematic, practical and entertaining at the same time. Books written by outsiders (such as university professors) are often strong on research and well-structured, but they tend to be too theoretical or even naïve for the practitioners. On the other hand, books written by businesspeople are sometimes just collections of anecdotes, they are often simplistic and specific to the author's circle of experience. Usually the best case is when businesspeople partner with professors (as in the case of the Balanced Scorecard) or when researchers go out to the \\"field\\" and actually observe how business success is achieved in real life (as in the case of First Break All the Rules). The worst case is of course, when conceited consultants with little practical experience or theoretical knowledge write a book after doing some sloppy \\"research\\" (a good example of that is businessThink - make sure to get your copy if you want to learn how to write something extremely arrogant and condescending).<br /><br />Thinking Inside the Box is a rare example of a businessman writing a book without too much bragging, with his own stories being short and relevant, and his research on other companies unusually thorough and well-referenced. All he promises is to summarize the basic rules of starting and operating a business, and he does exactly that, in a definitely entertaining style. The visualization he uses (the 12 rules are the planks of \\"the box\\") is a rather unnecessary addition, but - as a previous reviewer observed - it catches the eye of the would-be-buyers better.<br /><br />A peculiarity of this work is its conservative point of view. These days most business books urge you to continuously innovate, turn your business upside down and \\"think outside the box\\". Cheyfitz warns us that while modernization or transformation of your tools and methods is often necessary, it is always risky, so you should not temper too much with the basics of your business if it is going well. The last time I read anybody warning me that I should be cautious with innovations was Gerald Weinberg in Secrets of Consulting - and that was rather long ago. (\\"Nothing new ever works\\"- says Weinberg, which is of course a little exaggerated statement, but in my experience still not very far from the truth.) Paradoxically, being conventional is a highly unconventional (shall I say heretic?) attitude in today's business literature, probably this is why Thinking Inside the Box never made it to the bestseller list.<br /><br />Cheyfitz claims that there are some basic principles of business that have been unchanged for centuries, and will probably remain true for a long time in the future, so if you disregard them, you may soon be out of business. The book lists 12 \\"timeless rules\\" or \\"planks\\". Some of these rules are so simple that you would feel that the author wants to insult your intelligence had he not listed copious examples of businesses ignoring them. A couple of the rules in the second half of the book are not so trivial, and as such, probably more debatable than the rest, but still they come from a person who has applied them in practice, so they deserve at least careful consideration. Thus thebook is much more than a farewell speech to the \\"New Economy\\" invented in the .com period.<br /><br />The \\"planks\\" include the following (rephrased by me, for I do not have the book on me when writing this review):<br /><br />- Profitability is everything.<br /><br />You may start your business with a loss initially, but you must have a clear plan to achieve profitability. Sounds like a trivial chapter not worth reading? Cheyfitz quotes many well-known examples of not following this rule. We are living interesting times... (Our beloved Amazon.com is one of the examples. While I am a customer and fan of Amazon, I would not have slept peacefully at night if my money had been invested in this company. Yes, I know they have achieved profitability, but all too many .coms with similar strategies failed.)<br /><br />- Give customers what they want, not what you want to give them.<br /><br />Another \\"trivial\\" rule. While we know how powerful advertising can be, and it is often more useful to have good political relationships than good customer relationships, many companies could dramatically improve their bottom line by adopting such a philosophy. But in this neck of the woods not many companies seem to have discovered it yet (including the local branches of US multinationals).<br /><br />Just one recent example (I am sure you could add hundreds of others from your own experience): I bought a carpet on the Internet from Germany. I asked the seller to send it by a reputable company instead of the Postal Service. He answered it was impossible to find one. I thought he must be crazy, so I contacted GLS, UPS and some other companies who are supposed to be in the business of transporting goods from one place to another. It turned out that the seller was not crazy: all these firms with thousands of trucks running in Europe told me it was impossible for them to transport a f...ing rug over a distance of a few hundred miles if it is rolled (length: 3 m - 10 feet, weight 50 kg - 110 lbs). They did not even offer any alternatives (like: we can do it at an extra cost, we contacted another company that can do it for you...), they basically told me to go to hell. Eventually we had to transport the rug folded (which of course did not do it good). Will I be a loyal customer of any of these guys? You bet I won't, regardless of their reputation or marketing efforts.<br /><br />- Know what your main asset is (and protect it).<br /><br />The main asset may take different forms, but it is rarely something physical. The examples given by Cheyfitz help you understand the concept and find your own main asset. This is also sound advice, often followed but sometimes neglected even by otherwise good firms.<br /><br />- Do not build what you can buy.<br /><br />Your business can grow faster if you both grow it internally and at the same time you buy up good companies that have the expertise, customers, etc. You may buy companies even if they are in the red, assuming that you have a plan to turn them around. This is probably the most debatable of the 12 rules, since there are numerous examples of seemingly meaningful mergers with catastrophic results, so following this rule may lead you to unpredictable situations - while Cheyfitz cautions against such moves in the other chapters. True, Cheyfitz emphasizes that you should do your homework and look very carefully at what you buy, still I feel that by giving your customers what they want or by protecting your main asset, you take much less unnecessary risk than by buying up troubled firms to grow your \\"empire\\". Even so, this is a point that every business that wants to grow should seriously consider.<br /><br />(For a complete list of the rules, read the book : )<br /><br />I would make Thinking Inside the Box a mandatory reading at the beginning of MBA studies. It will be very helpful if you start a company with little experience, and probably even experienced busiensspeople will not regret reading it and consider whether they fully follow these classic rules.

You bet I won't, regardless of their reputation or marketing efforts. <br /> <br />- Know what your main asset is (and protect it). <br />The main asset may take different forms, but it is rarely something physical. The examples given by Cheyfitz help you understand the concept and find your own main asset. This is also sound advice, often followed but sometimes neglected even by otherwise good firms. <br /> <br />- Do not build what you can buy. <br />Your business can grow faster if you both grow it internally and at the same time you buy up good companies that have the expertise, customers, etc. You may buy companies even if they are in the red, assuming that you have a plan to turn them around. This is probably the most debatable of the 12 rules, since there are numerous examples of seemingly meaningful mergers with catastrophic results, so following this rule may lead you to unpredictable situations - while Cheyfitz cautions against such moves in the other chapters. True, Cheyfitz emphasizes that you should do your homework and look very carefully at what you buy, still I feel that by giving your customers what they want or by protecting your main asset, you take much less unnecessary risk than by buying up troubled firms to grow your \\"empire\\". Even so, this is a point that every business that wants to grow should seriously consider. <br /> <br />(For a complete list of the rules, read the book : ) <br /> <br />I would make Thinking Inside the Box a mandatory reading at the beginning of MBA studies. It will be very helpful if you start a company with little experience, and probably even experienced busiensspeople will not regret reading it and consider whether they fully follow these classic rules. Thinking Inside the Box is a book that will not become outdated anytime soon. <br />	2005-10-13

US	52423461	R2E6IQYQNE5MQW	0141019646	643055675	In Command Of History: Churchill Fighting And Writing Second World War	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	The Politician as Historian or Vice Versa?	I found this volume to be extremely interesting, even fascinating at times.  It focuses upon the writing of Winston Churchill's epic \\"The Second World War,\\" whose six volumes were a major publishing event around the world, and eventually earned Churchill a Nobel Prize for literature. It is really several different books in one. <br /> <br />    First, much like Ashley's \\"Churchill as Historian,\\" the author discusses the actual mechanics of writing so massive a project when Churchill had plenty of other things to keep him busy.  The \\"syndicate\\" of experts who assisted him, including even the Parliamentary Cabinet Office, is analyzed in great detail. According to the author, the \\"three D's\\" were the core of Churchill's method.  That is, first he had set in type the key documents which he had collected during his wartime service as Prime Minister. Then he tied the documents together with dictated reminiscenses.  Finally, the third \\"D\\" consisted of a very large number of drafts whereby the documents were edited down and the connecting narrative supplemented with WC's own recollections or papers drafted by syndicate members. Ironically, it is Churchill's heavy reliance upon documents that at once has yielded much praise from other historical researchers (since otherwise they would not have been made public for as much as 50 years after the war's conclusion),but also generated negative reactions from lay readers, especially in the U.S. <br /> <br />     Next, the really interesting issues are tackled.  For example, how candid and accurate was WC regarding his actions during the war?  The author extremely well documents how WC would edit documents, or even modify them, in order to (not surprisingly) put himself in the best historical light.  Also, he was duty bound not to reveal the existence of \\"Ultra,\\" which was the designation for breaking the German code during the war. Given the fact that in the postwar period, others were also writing books (e.g., Ike with his \\"Crusade in Europe\\" and Sherwood's \\"Roosevelt and Hopkins\\"), WC would frequently modify his drafts in order to obviate any possible taint regarding his decisions and actions while PM in a stab at vindication.  One good example was the dispute that arose over whether WC had favored or retarded the \\"Overlord\\" invasion of France in 1944. Churchill also faced the practical constraints of the Cold War being on-going and also acting as head of the Conservative Party and ultimately PM for a second time.  These factors too influenced how he structured the text. <br /> <br />     Of course a most intriguing question is did WC really write the work given the extensive assistance he received?  The author suggests a useful analogy: WC was like a master chef at a large restaurant who designs and directs the menu, while others do much of the actual food preparation.  He also likens it to a group project in science, where a number of folks collaborate on a paper which is attributed to the lead author. Clearly, it is Churchill's book even though he did not write all of it himself--but he reviewed every sentence and corrected or struck out that with which he disagreed.  <br /> <br />    Finally, in a most interesting discussion, the author recounts the arguments that arose during the 1955-1965 period as other historians, military figures, and the leaders of other countries (such as De Gaulle) took aim on Churchill's analysis.  Not quite as challenging as fighting Hitler, but still quite a nice war of its own.  The author, Professor of International History at Cambridge, has done just a superior job.  Be warned, it is a long book (over 600 pages) and the Penguin edition is set in very small type.  But the rewards of the book more than compensate for these problems, especially for those of us interested in Churchill. The stream of Churchill volumes continues unabated and has even increased recently--but this book should be singled out for the unique perspective it affords us on \\"the great man.\\"	2005-10-13

(Just look in Amazon.com at the number of books on Wyoming's historical sites as compared to other states and you'll see what I mean.) This book, probably a unique undertaking, lists not just highway commission historical signs (other states have published books on that), but EVERY sign that points out some piece of information of historical significance in the state, including, for example, all 30+ plaques one sees at Fort Laramie.<br /><br />The signs/sites are arranged by county; each county has a basic map pinpointing each one by number. The numbering system is the same one used by the Wyoming Recreation Commission in 1967 in their inventory listing. The legend that appears on each sign is given completely, and a very specific location for each sign is likewise provided. Dozens of photographs also appear.

The main character Jack Paris a homicide detective on a scarce string of murder cases. The murders are vicious acts of crime and have nothing in common except for a small symbol found on the victims. However as the novel progresses Jack realizes that the murders have something to do with the murder of a cop and friend that occurred two years earlier.  <br /> <br />Richard Montanari's style consists of gruesome yet unique murders. Combing flashbacks with present writing. As well as, switching between the points of views from Jack Paris, and the murderers. Looking At things form the murders point of view and seeing them happen then transfers to Jack Paris where the reader sees things, as they are unraveled. These transformations keep the reader intrigued and wanting to continue to reed.  Montanari introduces many different kinds of human torture and unique techniques to slaughter people.

As Micah practices yoga to steady nerves (and baffle his guards) and cagily grills another guard about local soccer to gage location, Marie Helene and friends establish a remarkable network of well-connected souls (politically and strategically) and set more wheels in motion via their grassroots efforts (and wall-mounted Sheik Sheet) than the FBI can fathom, or match. <br /> <br />There's an unbelievable lack of bravado or ego to both of their tellings.  <br /> <br />And they describe Iraq - their time there, their friends and experiences - with such compassion and understanding, that the beleaguered country emerges almost as another character in the narrative. Their Iraqi translator, Nietzsche-enthusiast, friend and co-captive, Amir, is the wise, steady and  winning third character. And dog Zeugma the fourth. <br /> <br />The couple come across as the pair most likely to succeed, and shine, and make friends in compromising and dismal of circumstances. You'd want them on your side, Amir along, and dog Zeugma at your feet.  <br /> <br />Would recommend for all the narrative threads that weave through American Hostage: <br />The looting of Iraq's Sumerian heritage - the reason Micah (and Marie Helene) are in the country, reporting. <br />The nuanced portrait of America's role on the ground in Iraq. <br />The love story that manages to blossom in the unforgiving and unlikely terrain of Micah's captivity. <br />The complexity of politics and allegiances on the ground in modern-day Iraq - evidenced by the kidnapping itself and by the astoundingly complex network that Marie Helene establishes to secure Micah's release. <br /> <br />A story told by thoughtful and evocative narrators who just happen to be its stars. <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Bleachers <br />4 stars <br />Barrowed from Travis Miller <br />Fiction <br /> <br /> <br />A book for all football fans out there. A true winner, those people who know what the game of football is all about, can relate their own football experiences to this book.  Taking place in an old town of Messina, Texas, Neely Crenshaw decides to return 15 years later to bury his soon to die head high school football coach Eddie Rake.  The novel is breathe taking, as you read the book through the eyes of an old well known quarterback, and listen to old stories told by ex-Spartan football players, you won't believe what you have read.  It is like your there, you can really feel what's happening.  <br /> <br /> <br />This is an easy read.  The style of Grisham is mostly about court related stuff, but is off his normal subject.  Once you start reading this book, you're not going to want to put it down.  You can feel what kind of pressures there are as a quarterback everyone knew 15 years ago, and coming back to the town where everyone still talks about you, and you just don't want to be there.  Grisham really tells you how a crazy football town really can be.  When Friday nights come rolling around, the whole down, and even it police are at the game, because no one is doing anything else.  You can feel how intense each player is about football, after going through seasons with old head coach Eddie Rake.  The whole town loves the guy because he always wins, and runs the whole town of Messina.  When one hot day in Messina, Rake calls for a Sunday practice.  He runs the kids for hours around the track and up the bleachers.  One kid falls down and dies.  From that point on Rake was done with the town, and got to Rakes head.  Reading this book you feel like your part of the Spartan team.  When the end of the book comes, you wonder why Neely Crenshaw, and the past Spartan player, put their selves through such hell. <br />  <br />	2005-10-13

US	46899882	R311ZEODIPOBV6	0671458183	851439417	Monsignor Quixote	Books	5	7	9	N	N	PEOPLE OF FAITH	This is one of the funniest and cleverest novels I have ever read. It is also one of the deepest. Behind the clever adaptation of the Don Quixote story to a context in post-Franco Spain there is a dance of ideas, much as Shaw's plays are a dance of ideas, and the questions dealt with are the biggest and most fundamental that we all have to deal with.<br /><br />An innocent and un-intellectual Catholic priest sets out on a holiday with a communist politician, and their discussions, always friendly and courteous and greatly assisted by wine, centre on their respective faiths. The communist faith is much the more straightforward - the ex-mayor, defeated at a recent election, finds the general outlook of Marx congenial, he finds that doubt shackles freedom of action, and that's about as far as his introspection goes. Catholicism is about bigger issues altogether, such as do we go to heaven or to hell for all eternity, and the concepts involved, for someone who really thinks about them honestly, are sufficient to unseat anyone's mind. There is no real alternative to thinking about them, so in the interests of peace of mind what people do is to think about them not honestly but either ingenuously or disingenuously. Graham Greene, like Muriel Spark, was a convert to Catholicism, and like Dame Muriel his treatment of it in his writing is wry and ironic. What he really `believed' is not quite clear and I'm sure not meant to be. Indeed he even casts some doubt around the question of what `belief' actually consists of, and rightly so in my own view. At one point Father Quixote admits that a certain doctrine is one that he believes out of obedience, an admirable attitude for traditionalist believers whether Catholic or communist - you believe x because you're supposed to believe it and you'll be in trouble if you don't. Greene quite obviously sees that Catholic doctrine evolved as a book of rules to keep people under control. What started as religious and ethical teaching developed rapidly into thought-enforcement and thought-policing, but the matter goes even deeper - behind it all there is supposed to be a God whose word the ecclesiastical power-structure dispenses, and this God is not, like Marx, someone who certainly exists but only a hypothesis. How much further Greene wishes us to pursue this line of thought I'm not clear, but for me two considerations follow - firstly what is supposed to be God's word is actually a human construct foisted on the hypothetical God, something that to me seems outright blasphemy; and in the second place we have a clearer idea these days what the Creator has created, and such a Creator is not likely to bear much resemblance to Jehovah in the scriptures having to assert his authority against Baal, Dagon etc at intervals. Indeed if there is one crumb of comfort in the contemplation of such a Creator it's likely to be that he will take little or no notice of our insolence in presuming to speak for his intentions.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book Greene says something to the effect that in the absence of certain knowledge one goes for the next best thing. For him this is `faith', for me it's probability, as best I can assess that. Greene is able, as I am not, to find a sense of `believing' that takes in the soul as well as the mind. When I say that I believe something I mean that it seems to me true or probable, and considerations that bring me spiritual comfort are unrelated to belief in this sense entirely. Greene seems not to go so far, but I venture to think that he's nearer to my way of seeing things than to `faith' in the conventional sense. What is completely unmistakable is the irony with which he observes the way that the devout have of finding support in the scriptures and in philosophy built on them for convenient viewpoints and courses of action.<br /><br />The book is not so much about the rival ideas, nor even so much about what people do with these as about what the ideas do with peoplewho for some reason adhere to them, as if the ideas had taken on a higher life of their own, dominating and controlling the very people who create them and without whom they could never exist. This may indeed be what we call divine in them. What is divine in a more earthly sense about this book is the humour and ingenuity of it all. It is a simple story as well as a battle of ideas, and a touching one too, with emotion and human affection finally dominant over the intellectual side. A delightful book, a beautiful book and I would even say a great book.h people who for some reason adhere to them, as if the ideas had taken on a higher life of their own, dominating and controlling the very people who create them and without whom they could never exist.

This book is for someone like me who enjoys hilarious plots, hot sexy men, and heroines that are zany, tough, and lovable all at the same time. I just finished reading the entire series and now I am wondering what I will do at night without Stephanie! I'm already having Plum withdrawals. Each book in the series is equally good, and the books don't have to be read in the correct order for you to get the most out of the series. From Grandma Mazur and her morbid obsession with corpses, to Stephanie's sidekick Lula decked out in flambouyant spandex, it's hard to decide which character is the most endearing. I do NOT think this book series is for everyone... for example, definitely not recommended for those people who might be considering marching in an anti-NRA protest, or who might be of the southern Baptist denomination, or for those who tend to lace their shoes a little too tight. Also not a good book for a book club that enjoys deep moral discussions. But for simple down-to-earth folks like myself who enjoy a good read, a good time, and a good laugh.... I strongly urge you to start reading this FABULOUS series!	2005-10-13

US	52613612	R2YMRSY0Y8AH7A	0849943736	830010703	Obsessed	Books	3	8	9	N	N	A compelling read	Obsessed is the second novel I've read by Ted Dekker, the first being Thr3e.  All in all I found this book to be a compelling read.  There is good character development, a solid plot and good dialog.  Stephen, the main character in the story becomes \\"obsessed\\" with an object.  As the story progresses one can see how a person can become obsessed with something and go to great lengths to obtain it even nearly to the point of going beyond rational thinking.   I believe the author succeeds in getting this point across.  The antagonist (Rolf) is cold and calculating with a very sinister overtone which is carried thru to the end.  However there are a some glitches in the story like a few inconsistencies (when Stephen pulls a knife out of his sock) and a few other areas when the author skips over important details.  And, to be honest the premise is a bit concocted. One has to suspend belief a bit that a mother and son, separated at birth for nearly 30+ years just happen to live only 20 miles from one another  and that her byline in a newspaper just happens to be read by her son (but he doesn't know he's her son).   But, beyond these drawbacks the story I felt was solid.  The flashbacks to the Nazi concentration camps of WWII were lurid and wholly believable and connected the story well.  The story has a nice little plot twist at the end.  Even with the noted drawbacks I found the book very readable.	2005-10-13

The loss simply devastated their ten children. But the siblings were able to find comfort in some inexplicable signs which assured them that their beloved parents were reunited in heaven, at peace, and still present in the lives of all those who grieved for them. Thin Places: Where Faith Is Affirmed And Hope Dwells by their daughter describes some of these signs and the realization that the ethereal veil between what we know of life here on earth and what we believe about the afterlife in heaven can become transparent at times, revealing loving messages of faith, hope, and grace to hearten us in our daily lives. Thin Places is a remarkable testament and very highly recommended reading for all those, whatever their faith, who suffer the loss of loved ones from their lives.	2005-10-13

The ability to bind multiple plug-ins to create a comprehensive, repeatable, and reusable team and project collaboration environment. <br /> <br />What I really enjoyed in reading this book, is the writing style and the format of the book.

As a bonus, King recommends my standby reference on writing, \\"Elements of Style,\\" by William Strunk Jr. & E.B. White.<br /><br />Leave it to King, The Master, to write this semi-autobiographical expose on authorship craft in a more intriguingly unique organizational setup than anyone else could conjure or dare. Leave it to Him to force (or else) a (sort of) \\"how to\\" book into mesmerizing entertainment; to step into the job with a horrific grab about a kid suffering ear drum puncture; and to coerce an anomaly of styles and content to coalesce into a gestalt of genius which WORKS, period.<br /><br />How can a book on writing be riveting?? Read it and see.<br /><br />King includes only those riveting parts of his personal history which have contributed to his writing career. He includes only the necessary elements to \\"teach\\" how to spark and stir creative fires. He includes only the necessary keys to his success (amazingly, he does know what those keys are).<br /><br />I was impressed with King's exposure of his method of writing from a SITUATION rather than from a precise PLOT outline; I still find myself chewing on that daring technique (though I do still appreciate a strongly plotted story).<br /><br />I was interested in his examples of bad and good prose, and agree with his praise of other works, though I reserve judgment on a few of his criticisms, and have developed techniques to take breaks whenever I need them without permanently losing a creative flow, which I can renew at almost any point if I can set up the right conditions.  (When I break through with as many Number One Best Sellers as Mr. King has, maybe my opinion on writing will be as viable as his.)<br /><br />King has many times earned the right to have an opinion on writing and to offer it for sale. Yet, he has approached this project with genuine humility, which is, to me, endearing (sorry about the sentimental slip, Oh Master of Horror).<br /><br />What do I admire most about this author, which is evident in this book? I absolutely enjoy his regenerating honesty, his uncanny originality, and his demand of himself to toss reader boredom into a black hole and perform, within his printed words, 24/7 without fail. Also love the way he sincerely and humbly exposes his respect for his wife.<br />Given what this man has endured and accomplished in his life, he's earned the best type of REST available to a human being, and I don't mean the big \\"D.\\" He deserves to be quite proud of himself. He deserves to have his thumbs permanently posed in the sides of a vest, to sit back and smile at his trail of effort and result.<br /><br />What a gift that he would attempt in earnest to share his secrets of writing success. And his uncanny self-awareness allowed him to share clearly what those secrets are, in this valuable gift for the youngest as well as the most seasoned of writers. This I say as a 2 decades professional writer and previous English and creative writing teacher who has published various articles and finished and polished 8 fiction manuscripts and has another 8 + book-length works in progress.  I'm not EVEN near King's level in the marketplace (yet), but I am a highly productive creative spirit who knows how to maintain, ride, and design the flow.<br /><br />There's always more than one way to approach any creative endeavor, and my approach to writing is similar to King's in some ways, somewhat different in other ways (I can only compare, of course, to the content offered in this book).  This insight to King's techniques exposes what works for him and what could work for other, though of course not all creative spirits.  Young writers should allow themselves leeway in deciding how to tap and work with their talents.  Creativity should be allowed to flourish, even when establishing a personal method on how to use that force, and sometimes it's necessary to forge a unique path diverging from even the greatest masters.  When I was teaching creative writing in the public school systems, I asked my students to at least try some of the established methods of writing prior to setting any of them aside to break away from them.<br /><br />Another great book which exposes a writer's path and techniques (through a novel rather than through a unique how to book) is THE NOVEL by James A. Michener.  See my review.<br /><br />What I believe On Writing has exposed better than many writing \\"how to\\" books is tapping into the Right Brain.  As I've observed the styles of many authors of novels, they each seem to be almost \\"designed\\" by DNA to work in different precise balances of Right/Left Brain.  The Left Brain wants steps, plots, outlines, plans and structure to be elaborately perfect prior to that leap into the ozone.  The pure Right Brain wants only the chaos of riding a storm of the absolute unknown, describing it as it explodes into the presence of present time, constantly changing, churning.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, telling a fledgling writer how to do it is, for me, a frightening extension of my uniqueness, because I would not ever want to hamper the growth of a maverick creative source needing by its design to walk a path not taught by any master before him.  Possibly every \\"how to\\" book should carry a warning.<br /><br />This one enters the effort in fairness, with humility and honesty, and does not say or imply, \\"This is THE only way to write.\\"<br /><br />Thank you, Stephen, for sharing your personal and professional views on writing, which expose your adept use of both sides of the brain, highlighting your ability to slip into the quirks of the Right side in intriguingly clear ways.  Not all writers can explain how that slip into the ozone happens.  Great books have been produced with various balances of Left & Right.

I had worried that by book three the brilliant Dave Putnam would have run out of steam in his Gamekeeper Series.  I needn't have feared as 10 Downing Street continues with the English Commonwealth controlling most of the Earth and a communist conspiracy existing which builds toward  a massive World War II.  It is more than just capitalism against communism and Putnam reveals he can just as handily explore different economic systems as he has done so beautifully in dealing with politics, war, working with animals, and especially religion.  The alternate world series continues with the addition of new characters and making excellent use of old ones from the first two books.  Winston Churchill again reigns supreme, at least for a while as this book covers a great number of years.  More time is spent with the most  interesting Albert Einstein.  You find Dwight D. Eisenhower, Rommel, and George Patton as well.  Historical figures are dealt with in a way that will convince the reader that the author knows his history. The fictional ones are as real and alive as any you'll find in the very best of novels. He also doesn't make the mistake of bringing in characters that could not have been born after history took a major twist in the 1890's.  The work is brilliant, there are twists and surprises and even the sometimes too long technical descriptions are interesting.  The author also knows how to tell decent love stories and to treat women as human beings.  Toward the end there is a touch of Asimov and Clement, however I don't want to be a spoiler. What I like best is that unlike Turtledove and some other science fiction authors, Putnam isn't afraid to make religion and the fact that God exists as a vital part of his universe as it is in our real universe.  As a Christian I did not agree with all the views expressed, but I was not offended as the three books have the feel of being written with love.   The best  news is that a 4th book follows and I will order it just as soonas I post this review.  Dave Putnam's novels deserve to be considered classics.	2005-10-13

Not only is this book poorly written (states and restates the obvious), but it is geared for those seeking LDRs--namely, overseas (as another reviewer wrote).  And let's face it: most LDRs don't work out, especially off the Internet. <br /> <br />The better book to buy is \\"'I Can't Believe I'm Buying This Book': A Commonsense Guide to Successful Internet Dating\\" by Evan Marc Katz.  Not only is Katz a great writer in that he's intelligent, funny, and knowledgeable (he formed the Internet dating consulting firm, E-Cyrano, and was a consultant at AmericanSingles and JDate), but Katz's commonsense info makes lots of sense. <br /> <br />Save your money and don't buy \\"How to Get the Man of Your Dreams Using the Internet.\\"  Mine's going straight on the \\"Sell Yours Here\\" at Amazon. Yet, if you listen to me, the book will rightfully stay on \\"Sell Yours Here\\" forever.	2005-10-13

Quick and good overview of what you need to know about several topics. <br /> <br />On to the specifics of this book. You get a great outline of what you can do with JBoss including some good introductory info on Java EE in general. Some will find the lack of detail irritating but its great for a quick overview of how the stuff is done 'in the real world'. For example in Chapter 3 aobut creating a 'real application' the topic of XDoclet is discussed but not in great detail (Norman Richards has a huge 350+ page book on XDoclet) leaving the (sometimes ardious) task of getting XDoclet working with ant as an exercise to the reader. <br /> <br />The authors do a great job of writing in an informal conversational way without being campy. <br /> <br />Specific Content: <br />1) Installing JBoss - everything you want to know about getting JBoss up and running. Any deficencies here are made up for in Chapter 9 on rolling out jboss. <br /> <br />2) Deploying Apps - the stuff you need to know about how to deploy, talks about auto-deploy and how to do exploded deployments. <br /> <br />3) Creating the complete app - I liked this chapter but I susspect that newbies will find the XDoclet stuff confusing. XDoclet is great and works like a champ but many people will wonder what is going on if they don't have previous XDoclet expierence. <br /> <br />4) Connecting to a real db - good stuff, esp liked the bit on monitoring. Lots of folks new to Java EE don't get that whole monitoring thing and this book talks about it a lot (in most chapters). <br /> <br />5) Secutiry - all you need to know to get started with secutring in JBoss, using LDAP & hashed passwords are covered which a lot of preliminary discussions seem to leave out. <br /> <br />6) Logging - welcome to the world of Log4J which should be really simple but somehow required lots of pages in lots of books to document. This chapter has what you need to know about to get logs going with JBoss. You are using remote debugging from your IDE though to debug your apps though aren't you? <br /> <br />7) Configuring Persistence - good quick over view to CMP and getting the CMP engine to manage your schema. <br /> <br />8) Managing and Monitoring JBoss - a whole chapter on how to manage JBoss. Lots of good info here. <br /> <br />9) Rolling out JBoss - all the stuff you might forget to do in turning on a production version of JBoss. All about security and closing the holes that you might not think to close (like the class download service). <br /> <br />Over all a great book and worth the $.	2005-10-13

It is a relevant story about white collar crime,with an interesting twist to it at the end of the book. This twist also happens to be a 'present value'. I enjoyed the book, especially when I got to the end and the story suddenly came together.The middle got a little bogged down trying to explain the nature of  this crime, and for one who isn't in the finacial world it can be a bit tedious, and not important to the enjoyment of the story.

The book gives no \\"conclusions\\" about any topic, but instead presents every piece of research done.  She includes research that was conducted before the medical community had a strong understanding of MS and research conducted even before disease modifying medications were developed.  To make matters worse, the does nothing to summarize or explain the findings in a meaningful way. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the author's tone and language is incredibly offensive.  She refers to people with multiple sclerosis as \\"disabled\\" throughout and even goes so far as to suggest that they are \\"deteriorating\\".  In her relationships section of the book she says something to the extent that people with MS might not be able to find relationships, but don't worry because there are plenty of other disabled people longing for companionship.  As if those with MS are unworthy of affection from someone without a chronic illness.  Or, my personal favorite, she claims that MS can make existing relationships hard now that one person in the relationship is deteriorating.  This kind of language is prevalent throughout the book. <br /> <br />Painfully brief excerpts from patient stories are included.  It's nice to hear whether someone experienced a relapse after giving birth, for example, but you don't know anything else about them - how long had they had MS, what form of MS they have, how soon after birth did they return to medication, what did their relapse rate look like before becoming pregnant?  Without any context, these tid-bits are useless.  And the ones about bad experiences are particularly nerve wracking. <br /> <br />Overall, this book was not in the least bit informative, and does a lot to damage spirit and hope.  I'd suggest that you save yourself the money and just have a good chat with your Neurologist and OBGYN. <br />	2005-10-13

As this book demonstrates, you get a version of Havel that neo-cons have been peddling since President Bush the 1st and Francis Fukuyama: a Vaclav Havel who appears to be a quirky surrogate for American conservative thought.  True, Havel drifted into this mold during his presidency years of the 1990s. But the \\"dissident\\" Havel of the 70s and 80s was no Leo Strauss. And the attempt to squeeze him into this framework, as this book does, is pretty unsatisfying.

This is a great book! I believe makeup should be fun, and enhance your natural beauty.  It should be something nice that you do for yourself, like reading a good book in a candle lit bubble bath, taking care of your skin on a daily basis, or buying yourself fresh flowers. It should be an extension of who you are, not make you into another person; makeup should perk you up, not make you up.  Robert Jones has taken the mystery out of makeup, and made it simple and accessible for everyone.  This book includes fabulous pictures of REAL women of all ages and ethinic backgrounds (only a few of whom are professional models) in before-and-after makeup transformations.  It also includes a glossery of cosmetic terms; an awesome section on product knowledge that covers foudation, concealer, powder, eyebrow, eyeshadow, mascara, eyliner, and lipstick; a great section on cosmetic tools; an absolutely wonderful section on chosing the right foundations and colors for YOU; and detailed instructions on how to apply everything!  I'd say this book focuses on preparing the skin, applying foundations, and transforming eyes (including brows). There is lots of useful, detailed information on applying makeup for your face shape, and eye shape.  I only gave this book 4 stars (but would have given it more like 4.5 stars if I could) because I was disappointed that it did not go into more detail about the lip colors used on the ladies.

The good/excellent ones don't say a lot of useful stuff, the bad ignore the feat he is attempting by writing 13 books, and the ugly sound like idiots.   <br /> <br />I will admit, I have bashed the hell out of Jordan quite a bit in my reviews due to his last several horrible books.  In fact, he almost single-handedly turned me off of fantasy as book genre.  <br /> <br />Despite his last few failures, this book actually does alright in moving plot forward granted a bit slowly.  It sucks he ignores Rand, but frankly Rand is a bit annoying to me anyway, so the focus on Matt was a welcome change.  His writing had a bit more action than his last few flops. <br /> <br />However, in the grand world of writing, just because his last book was significantly better than his last few books, it doesn't warrant a five star rating.  If I eat a bowl of doodoo for three weeks, and then I am offered Mcdonalds, it doesn't make Mcdonalds a five start meal because of what I was eating before.  There is my point about relativity in this book. <br /> <br />I guess my conclusion in this book is, it is definitely an improvement but keep in mind what his last few books were like.  Finally,  I have to ask how the hell Jordan plans to wrap all these loose strands of plot into a conclusion.  If he succeeds in this feat even decently, that will make this series a feat in itself regardless of a few bad books.	2005-10-13

The fact that the accounts are presented in the player's own words add tremendously to the book's validity and substance. Though any reader will appreciate the breadth and depth of this book, those of us who are particularly interested in the subject are very grateful for this contribution that expands on a chapter of baseball of which too little has been written.  Well planned and well executed.\\"  <br />	2005-10-13

She made it seem like Ice-T helped her in her time of need when we all know Ice-T proclaims to be a P-I-M-P proudly.  He didn't just give her money for the sake of it.  He was making an investment and I'm sure she walked the strip for him.  It's apparent to me that Karrine left out a lot of details from her so called story(she never spoke about all the lavish trips she took around the country that should have been the highlight of her life).Her idea of traveling around the country was to Miami, New York, Arizona and Los Angelos and she mainly spoke of only the people who mis-treated her along the way & for those who didn't she never told about her trysts with them.  I mean really people no movie director is going to put you up in a movie with stars of the likes Larenz Tate & Vin Diesel without even reading for the part or prior acting experience.  And why is it Chuck always had the hookup for her.........Hmmm i believe she did him to.  Karrine is responsible for Karrine using her mother as a scapegoat for the things that happened to her in her life.I have no sympathy.  Karrine was penniless & broke what other way to dig herself out of the gutter and write a tell all book and fabricate some of her experiences.  Don't women usually try to do better then what their mom did regardless.  Since writing this book do you honestly think or believe Karrine has changed for the better.  Nah of course not she just moved on to the next best thing Bill Maher no one in the industry (hip-hop anyway) is going to want to touch her since this book so she doesn't really have a choice.  If anything I feel more for her son. And hopefully this time around she will manage her money wisely.	2005-10-13

I also used \\"Hawaii Revealed\\" on a visit to the big island with similar results. In many other places you are taking a chance on the reliability and accuracy of reviews of activities, reviews, directions, etc. but I find this book is right on. Since it's written from experience, I've found you can rely on the descriptions without question. The vendors for activities were exactly as described. The ways to beaches were exactly as described. The restaurants were exactly as described. While it's not all-inclusive (it's pretty hard to stay at every possible condo), the authors provide enough choices that they have personally explored that you will have plenty of choices too.<br /><br />A reminder to the reviewer who calls us tourists \\"maggots\\" - we are providing your economy and supporting the peoples of the state in so many ways. The book makes many, many references to the need to respect private property, and for respecting the ecosystem as well. It's up to the visitor to do this, really - I've always felt a strong sense of \\"visiting\\" in Hawaii, the spirit of the Hawaiian place and peoples is very strong to me and I feel like I am privileged to share some time with the sights and features. I urge other visitors to similarly respect the traditions and ecosystem when you visit.

Mr K is positively bubbling with enthusiasim.  Had it not been taken by Joe Namath a suitable title might have been \\"The Future's So Bright I Just Gotta Wear Shades\\".  But therein lies the problem.  Mr K comes across more like a passionate evangelical than a reasoned scientist.  Whenever someone is absolutley convinced about the rightness of his assumptions I become skeptical. <br /> <br />     If you're reading this you know the premise of the book.  Mr. K maintains that the pace of technological change (and by technology he means the really cool technologies, like infotech, biotech, and nanotech) is not simply increasing, but increasing exponentially, so fast that we will soon reach a point where man and machine have become one, and are brains are a million (or maybe a billion) times more powerful.  When this happens everything we know will have changed forever. <br /> <br />     Moreover, this is not someting that will happen at some vague time in the far future.  It's just around the corner.  Mr. K even gives us a date: 2045. <br /> <br />     While reading the book I kept thinking, What if Mr. K had written this in the mid 1950's?  Certainly he'd have backup for his basic premise--the changes that occured in the first half of the 20th century were indeed tremendous.  Take aviation, a hot technology in those days.  Mr. K would no doubt have observed that we went from Kitty Hawk to the Boeing 707 in just 50 years.  Projecting ahead, Mr. K would have concluded that the second half of the century would see an even greater rate of advancement, so that by now we'd all have our own personal flying devices, zipping off to Europe in just minutes. <br /> <br />    But that hasn't happened.  Certainly there has been signigicant progress in aviation in the last 50 years, but not like the 50 years before that.  In some says it's worse.  I suspect that since 9/11 the time it takes to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco (from the time you get to one airport to the time you leave the other) may be longer now than it was in the 1950's. <br /> <br />    Why has this happened?  A lot of this has to do with social conditions, not technological ones.  Supersonic trasport never got off the ground (so to speak) in part because people didn't want the sonic booms near populated areas.  These same social factors may well put the brakes on a lot of what Mr. K predicts. <br /> <br />     It's not that Mr. K's book isn't based on hard science.  It's positively larded with science, so much so that my eyes tended to glaze over many times.  It's just that he doesn't seem very critical.  While he does acknowledge the existence of contrary opinion, he quickly (albeit politely) dismisses any cautionary thoughts.  Those who disagree with his beliefs are clearly stuck-in-the-mud, nay-saying Luddites. <br /> <br />    Mr K is obviously a brilliant, well-informed scientist.  I don't have enough knowledge to judge the accuracy of his facts, except in a few situations.  When that does occur, though, I become unimpressed.  For example, he spends a few pages talking about the increases that have occured in life expectancy, and uses this to project further increases to 150 years and then to 500 years.  But he fails to distinguish between life exoectancy and life span.  The former has indeed increased, but the latter has not.  I am certain Mr. K knows the difference.  His failure to make the distinction is misleading and disingenuous.  It makes me wonder about the veracity of the rest of the book. <br /> <br />     As to the book itself, it's far too long.  He repeats his points so much it seems as though he thinks that by mere repetition the reader will become more convinced that he's right.  And some parts of the book are simply annoying, like the smug pseudo-conversations among past, present, and future personages that appear throughout the work. <br /> <br />To his credit, though, his optimisim about the future is refreshing, and certainly an antidote to the dystopian views typical in literature and Hollywood (Brave New World, 1984, Blade Runner, Mad Max, The Terminator, Waterworld, etc.). <br /> <br />     The bottom line here is that Mr. K. doesn't seem to remember that virtually all predictions about the future are wrong, since the predictions are simply extrapolations of current trends.  The future is never what we think it will be, and Mr. K is no exception. <br /> <br />     Then again, he could be right.  If so, I just hope I can live long enough to enjoy the sigularity, so I can have my body filled with nanobots and my brain uploaded to (as he would say) a suitable substrate.  Maybe being a cyborg won't be so bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />     <br />	2005-10-13

I cannot imagine what it must be to have lost both your husband (and all he was to you during your 45 years with him) and your daughter.  I hope that the strength you have shown in writing this book will continue to sustain you and make your life meaningful.  I read your book through quickly, as your thoughts and reactions were so much like mine, and seemed a validation that what I was feeling was okay and natural.  I lost my 44 year-old son in August, after taking care of him for three months (he was diagnosed with an inoperable, stage 4 brain tumor in April, and we tried everything to save him.)  I understand the vortex of memories, appearing from nowhere, bringing you to your knees.  I discovered that the reason I couldn't sleep was that I was still half-awake listening for my son to get up during the night, as he did so often.  Closing my bedroom door has helped.  We spent so much time in the car driving to labs, the ER, doctor appointments - always with the radio playing the music he loved -and now the only thing I can stand is songs sung in Spanish - because lyrics that you can't understand can't hurt you.  So, yes, the book and the way it was written was, for me, an opportuunity to talk intimately with someone who knew how I was feeling.  It grates on me to read reviews of the quality of the writing.  This writing was from the heart, and it spoke to mine.	2005-10-13

The first ones, Templars and Hospitallers, were founded in the XII Century, after the First Crusade, in order to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land and to provide humanitarian and medical services. Soon, these monks became more warriors than anything else, true machines of war which came to be the first organized and properly trained and disciplined professional elite troops in the West since the Roman Empire. The West and Islam lived then (and still do) in a permanent state of threat and holy war. Although these warriors made vows of poverty, obedience and chastity, they soon accumulated enormous riches, fighted one another and their discipline, especially in sexual matters, relaxed.<br /><br />The first part of the books tells the two centuries of Christian occupation in the Holy Land, which the Islam had taken by force centuries before, and where, despite some resounding successes, the Christians ended up being totally defeated and expelled, to this day. The second part tells the story of the Crusade in the Baltic, performed by the Teutonic Knights against the pagan Slav Prussians, terrifying cannibals adoring spirits in trees, as well as snakes in the woods. These Teutonics founded what was probably the first \\"modern\\" state: Prussia (the German one). This story is practically unknown, in spite of being totally fascinating. The third part is the Reconquest of Spain, where the orders were crucial in defeating the Moors. Then come the stories of the Hospitallers in Rhodes and Malta -also wonderful- and then what became of the existing orders today.<br /><br />One striking common theme during the thousand years covered is the permanent and bloody conflict between the West and Islam. In spite of the torrent of names, places and dates, this book is an incredible collection of adventures and improbable deeds, especially the sieges of Acre, Rhodes and Malta, as well as the Spanish Reconquista and the Prussian episode. The tone of the book is apologetic, the author himself being a Knight of Malta, but it also vividly portraits the terrible atrocities committed by both sides. It fills a huge vacuum in the historical and political education of almost any reader, besides being an impressive saga of courage, dedication, violence, survival, glory, triumph, defeat and corruption at the same time. It really motivates you to read more about this subject.on of adventures and improbable deeds, especially the sieges of Acre, Rhodes and Malta, as well as the Spanish Reconquista and the Prussian episode.

In Volume 4, Masumi is off to study at England's Royal Ballet Academy.  There she must confront her rival, the fiery Sidney Ecklund, as well as overcome her own artistic shortcomings.  Along the way she also meets and receives encouragement from legendary ballerina Margot Fonteyn. <br /> <br />\\"Swan\\" is interesting is that it deals with the reality of ballet - auditions, nerves, endless practices, and injuries.  As a dancer myself, I can identify to some extent with Masumi's love for ballet and her desire to excel.  We also get to meet leading lights from the ballet world of the 1970's (when this manga was written and takes place) - Maya Plisetskaya, Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, and the Bolshoi Ballet. <br /> <br />What bothers me about \\"Swan\\" is its heavy-handed, soap-opera-esque, OMG EMOTION that saturates every page.  I know that this can be a regular occurrence in manga, but there are times when I wanted to smack Masumi upside the head and tell her to get a grip - the girl cries, as one character notes, \\"at the drop of a hat.\\"  But the most glaring problem with \\"Swan\\" is the lack of fact-checking.  The real-life dancers and ballets are misspelled or misidentified - \\"Margaret\\" Fonteyn, Maya \\"Prisetskaya\\", \\"The Hunchback Pony\\" (better known as \\"The Little Humpbacked Horse\\"), and who the heck is \\"WALDORF\\" Nureyev?!?  This may be a result of poor translation, but someone should have caught these blatant errors. <br /> <br />\\"Swan\\" is probably best for pre-teen and young teen girls perhaps dreaming of their own turn in the spotlight.  Older readers - especially those with some knowledge of ballet - might find it a bit too overdone.	2005-10-13

This asset-building approach to youth development and community development is solidly based on extensive research and meta-research.  Thousands of youth have been surveyed to yield the great information.  Written for parents, community volunteers and professionals who work with children & youth, it describes 40 qualities (or assets) which help youth thrive.  The more of the 40 assets a youth has the better he/she does.  A university student body president I knew felt he had 39 of the 40 assets; since I knew him to be a fabulous kid, it validated the asset-building framework for me.  I urge every parent to get and read this, apply what you learn to your kids, and then go out and make your community more youth friendly.  I have 3 copies; two of which are \\"loaners\\".	2005-10-13

The garrison was overrun and killed by troops under command of Nathan Bedford Forrest, one of the founders of the first KKK. Add the fact that many of the dead were black and the politically correct liberal left school of history is in full cry. The worst book on the subject is Richard L. Fuchs &#34;An Unerring Fire: The massacre at Fort Pillow&#34;. The only thing missing in that book is Forrest in formal Klan robes riding about extorting his lynch mob of an army to kill all blacks.<br /><br />Mr. Ward avoids these mistakes and produces what is the most evenhanded book we are likely to see. The Union Army in west Tennessee was a series of second or third-rate units with sever leadership problems. Black marketing, speculation in cotton, a hostile population and a habit of &#34;foraging&#34; contributed to the poor condition of these units. Into this mix came two distinct sets of regiments raised in the area; the United Stated Colored Troops comprised of freed slaves and the white &#34;loyalist&#34;, many of whom had deserted from the Confederate Army. Being in the USCT or a Tennessee Union regiment didn't change racial attitudes, dividing local commands even more. The isolated forts were to be abandoned but the profit in cotton was to attractive for Memphis to act quickly.<br /><br />Into this mix rode General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his very able command. Forrest had made Memphis his home before the war and many of his men were from the area. The book covers this 1864 raid in detail giving us a good understanding of the conditions Forrest's men face and the stories of &#34;foraging&#34; they had heard. Fort Pillow was targeted, invested, refused to surrender, overrun and a massacre occurred. Forrest lost control of his men but was never charged with any crime. It was impossible to build a case against the man that would hold up even in a Reconstruction Court.<br /><br />Having said all of this, why don't I like the book? &#34;Damned with faint praise&#34;; sums up the author's treatment of Forrest. In any question on where he was or what he was doing, the glass is always half empty. He should have been stopping the massacre not checking the gunboats on the river. However, these boats could have slaughtered his command if they had fought. &#34;The Wizard&#34; is used so often, in referring to Forrest, that it becomes a snide remark. Likewise, his Christian name was not &#34;Nathan Bedford Forrest, slave trader&#34;.<br /><br />The stories from the saviors of the massacre are told in stunning detail, as is the fate of the Union POWs, both white and black. This section of the book clearly illustrates how the &#34;hard hand of war&#34; was being applied. This is not a pleasant book to read but it is the best coverage of the subject I've found.<br />Having said all of this, why don't I like the book? &#34;Damned with faint praise&#34;; sums up the author's treatment of Forrest.

This is a wonderful book for many reasons. The slam on the snob journals, where they list the camera used (the author studiously lists the photocopier that best took the image) is one of my favorites. True, death isn't funny (or pretty), but hey, it is a jungle out there. If you are kind of a weenie, and can't bear to think of Bambi and Thumper buying it on the freeway, this is not the book for you. But with a title like \\"Flattened Fauna\\", why on earth would you consider buying it?  <br /> <br />This book is a gem in terms of dark humor. If that's your thing, you will enjoy it very much. If you think the world is full of sweet, adorable little animals bucking up on hind legs, talking in helium-altered baby voices, find a more suitable book, possibly in the children's section.	2005-10-13
US	53052943	R2ME3V21RQ1KCN	0060778385	210585208	Common Sense Business: Starting, Operating, and Growing Your Small Business--In Any Economy!	Books	5	6	7	N	N	For anyone who has even dreamed of setting up their own business	This is a terrific book for anyone who has ever considered or dreamed of going into business for himself (or herself).  Frankly, that is about everyone.  I suspect that you have thought about getting out of the 9-5 rat race or getting out of the cubicle farm, but have probably not made the leap into the unknown because too much is unknown and we have responsibilities that limit the risks we can afford to take.  This book is much like sitting around with an experienced and friendly uncle who takes you step by step through the things you absolutely must think through before you can seriously consider walking into the jungle of business with the hope of walking out rich.<br /><br />Steve Gottry bases this book on his own entrepreneurial efforts; some successful, others ended in bitter failure.  He not only shares the lessons he learned, but extends them into more general lessons about the broad considerations anyone in business must wrestle with.  He groups the twenty-three chapters in three broad parts.<br /><br />Part One is in two parts: The Small Business Life Cycle, and The Alternate Route.  The first part is for the person who has any kind of desire to be in business, but doesn't know what he would face.  It starts with the dreaming stage and helps you get to something more solid.  Of course, most of the dreams we have would make lousy businesses, but if you pan enough in the stream of ideas you might find a nugget of real gold.  Such is one path to business.  He then takes you through the planning and implementation stages.  Once you are in business you hope you will have to deal with growth.  You will also likely have to adapt and evolve your business, and at some point you will sell it, close it, or pass it on to heirs.<br /><br />The Alternate Route takes you through what you must consider if things go badly and you have to deal with creditors and possibly bankruptcy.  He also guides you through your second start-up.  Realistically, if you have what it takes to be on your own, you will never be happy working for someone else for the long term.  You might have to get a paycheck to get back on your feet, but you will eventually head out on your own once again.<br /><br />Part Two takes you through the process of building on your assets.  This is not as obvious as it might seem because it really is more than just your genius product or service.  In order to build a loyal customer base, to fight off competitors, to have a great employee team, and to be happy with your life, you really do need to think through these issues.<br /><br />Part Three takes you through those negatives in yourself and your company that can drag you down.  They include being distracted by being busy with non-core activities, a poisonous employee or culture, being sloppy, too much debt, getting on the wrong side of Uncle Sam, and letting your fears keep you from doing what must be done.  It is a painful look in the mirror, but to be successful look you must!<br /><br />One feature of this book I particularly like is the \\"Thinking It Through\\" section at the end of each chapter.  He lists the core questions the chapter raised and leaves spaces for you to write out your answers.  Actually, the answers will be too detailed to fit in the few lines he leaves you, but they are there to suggest - demand - that you take the time to not move forward until you have written out the answers to these questions.  Not that you will get them set down once and for all, but that you start the process of thinking in a serious way.  Writing it down forces you to organize your thoughts and helps you judge them critically.  So write.<br /><br />This is not a textbook and many of the issues he raises here will start you on your process.  You will need to study some of them more deeply or get professional guidance to supplement your own skills.  It reads easily and that is great, but make sure you take the time to seriously answer the questions he poses.  Even if you are already in business, you will likely pick up a helpful point or three.<br /><br />Handy book.en if you are already in business, you will likely pick up a helpful point or three.   <br /> <br />Handy book.	2005-10-13

More than 90% of the authors training material is right on the mark. But, I was disturbed by the fact that the author commits several chapters to constitutional law and a good deal of time on how to thwart the police in investigations. <br /> <br />While the author is certainly entitled to his views I felt a little mislead by the title. I am a firearms trainer and am always looking for new material. I had never read anything by Mr. Farnam before but he title seemed relevant so I bought the book.

The authors seemed to make huge statements without backing them up with scripture. There was hardly any scripture used, and when it was, it seemed off topic or out of context.<br /><br />We started using the companion book for our discussions, but quickly turned to writing our own discussion questions. The questions were poorly written, and most of them were simply yes/no. We began writing questions challenging each other to find scripture that illustrated certain points that the Eldredges were trying to make. We were able to easily find more adequate scriptures, and we started to wonder if the book had been written in a huge rush and they hadn't had time to look for better scriptures (too much time watching movies, I guess).<br /><br />There are so many better books out there. This was weak and fluffy and seemed to focus more on what fantasy and movies have to say about love and beauty than what the Bible says.

Above all, relevant	This is an important and also a very enjoyable book.  That in itself is a rare combination, and worthy of attention. <br />As a UK reader with no legal background I was afraid that much of the material might be mysterious or irrelevant to me, but I could not have been more wrong.   <br />Misfits in America is volume 1 of a quartet, but it can be happily read alone.  The author has a sharp and amusing style, and never pulls his punches.  His take on events of the mid twentieth century is refreshing, absorbing and relevant to modern events, and the language is pitched at the intelligent lay reader, not solely at fellow lawyers.  The book deals with  subjects important to the conduct of a free democracy - the conduct of law schools abd the legal system, the relations of the legal system and the political system, and especially the legality of wars declared by the President rather than by Congress.  This might sound dry (and I am making it sound pompous, when it certainly isn't), but it comes vividly to life and sheds light on subsequent events.  The author's reflections on Vietnam have led me to consider and partly revise my views on the Iraq war and Britain's involvement in it, no mean feat! <br />	2005-10-13

I picked this up because Pringle's biography was a Pulitzer Prize winner, written close in time to the subject matter. I was disappointed in the writing style and the lack of penetrating analysis. It is like a stone skipping over the lake. Subsequent authors have done much better and that might be expected as history and the passage of time provide their separate illuminations. Still, Pringle had the benefit of first person, first generation sourcing and I expected more as a result. Pringle's three paragraph forward to the book's re-release in 1955 laid a clear foundation. He said he would have failed completely unless he proved that T.R. was never dull. I have to say Pringle tantalizingly cracks that door but doesn't expand on it. I found his sidebar comments on various contemporaries of Roosevelt, especially as some have been lost to history, more interesting. Intriguing side streets that I intend to pursue. In fact, that only would be my recommendation for this book. <br /> <br />However, Pringle never fleshes out Roosevelt. Pringle seems to catch his outline, his reactions to events, circumstances or people, but fails to deliver T.R. himself. This might suffice as a brief introduction to Roosevelt but much more interesting and illuminating biographies are now available.	2005-10-13

Books	5	12	26	N	N	A View of Combatting Radical Islam	Tony Blankley argues that the rise of radical Islamist jihadists poses a threat to the United States and an even worse threat to Europe. I would say that he believes that the threat of cultural warfare is the biggest problem facing out future. He asserts that too many politicians and journalists believe that our challenges are business and politics as usual and ignoring the real problems.  He also presents a view of the ultra right wing Christians that is rather refreshing. Basing our entire set of laws on books written in the middle-east a thousand or two years ago  doesn't seem to make an awful lot of sense.  <br /> <br />A lot of what he says makes a lot of sense. But a lot causes me trouble. One thing missing is the impact on the future world of global warming and the ending of a society, a culture, based on oil. Any predicition of the future that doesn't have an entry for oil in the index causes me concern. <br /> <br />I am also reminded of the old comment by Benjamin Franklin (also attributed to Thomas Jefferson) that 'He who sacrifices freedom for security is neither free nor secure.' Unfortunately his solution seems to me to require the sacrifice of several freedoms and I'm not so sure that they give us any more security.  <br /> <br />This book is well worth reading to see the thinking behind his proposals. If you agree with him or not is up to you, but this is the way that a surprising percentage of the people are beginning to think.	2005-10-13

Canby, unable to face the loss of the woman he's worshipped since boyhood, and disillusioned by the hypocrisy of his aristocratic life, fakes his death and becomes Jack, aka The Falcon, a spy for the crown. Years later, Jack's past returns to haunt him when Selena, now widowed, is arrested for Canby's murder. Leaving a crucial mission in limbo, Jack returns to England to break Selena out of prison - without revealing his true identity. But how can Selena trust the mysterious man who appears out of nowhere to save her? Surely he has some ulterior motive for his good deed.<br /><br />Historical romance readers will love Jack and Selena's touching story. Donna Birdsell's beautiful prose shines, and the ending is not what you expect!  Don't miss Falcon's Mistress.	2005-10-13

Muzj, a literate scholar who can communicate with the non-specialist, picks several of the most classic icon images and explicates them in short essays that are nevertheless dense with observation, learning, and insight.<br /><br />The entire book is on acid-free paper and the reproductions are carefully picked from the best examples of each iconic image known.  The major Russian schools are represented in more than one image to aid the learner in becoming familiar with them.  Muzj also provides diagrams of the way the space is utilized in each image to unfailingly lead the eye to the central mystery of faith being revealed behind each icon.<br /><br />In short, there is a great deal of learning packed here into a relatively small volume for a quite reasonable price.  Especially for Western tradition Christians who have only appreciated icons from a distance, this remarkable book is a door to a whole new world.	2005-10-13

Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie just brings the hardships and toils of the Oregon Trail to life, like a movie or event you've never seen before. This book has a lot of romance, suspense, and shows a lot of dept for history. <br /> <br />When I first read this book, all I could do was just sit back and imagine what Hattie's family felt when they saw Oregon looked like for the first time. Or how they felt when they crossed rivers and rapids. There's a lot of dangers and adventures in this book, and it just makes me admire the courage of the pioneers of the 1840s. How they made it to a new land still amazes me. <br /> <br />This book is so fantastic and amazing. It just brings the year 1848 to life all over again. Great job Christina Gregory!!

No book has ever made me laugh and smile the way this did. Faced with many difficult situations in her young life, the straight shooting Daisy Fay possesses an inner strength that enables her to come out a winner. How could one not love such an innocent yet an insightful young woman? Kudos to Ms. Flagg for not giving us another typical victim of circumstance that cannot figure out how to pull herself up by her bootstraps! <br /> <br />After reading Flagg's Whistlestop novel, I was skeptical that this one could actually be AS good. But guess what? It was! After a couple chapters, or journal entries, I should say, I was hooked. \\"Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man\\" (earlier edition entitled \\"Coming Attractions\\") really made me grin with a tearful grin. So much (about 1/2) of the book is told from the perspective of an 11-year-old in a pretty messed-up family situation. Of course she doesn't realize this, and thus the writer escapes the trite trap. Her insights and honesty on the page really touched me. It was as refreshing as deep breath after a long walk--hits your lungs, exhilarating your whole heart....and again, the main character (can you guess her name?) was chock-full of hilarity; a real original! If you like good reading, you'll love Daisy Fay and her various scrapes and adventures, with \\"the Miracle Man\\", and Flagg's other kooky characters! (P.S. I would love to see this book turned into a movie.) <br /> <br />Flagg is a master at her craft and anyone looking for a great story should read this book.   <br />	2005-10-13

Scenes are painted so clearly and vividly that it's almost like watching a movie, and the character descriptions alone kept me turning the pages. The writing style takes a little time to get used to (seemingly never-ending sentences, parentheses galore), but once you do, the narrator becomes that much more real...like it's a story he's telling solely to you. There's an odd familiarity in the story and in the characters - \\"Stewardsville\\" is one of those books that stays with you after you're done reading it and you always seem to find yourself coming back to. Also, the author has an email address (stewardsville at gmail dot com) for the sole purpose of answering questions from readers.

While Eragon was riviting Eldest lays the ground work for the next chapter in the Inheritance saga.  To me, it seems as if Paolini is following in the footsteps of J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Just like Tolkien, Paolini's first book Eragon is but the first chapter, it's exciting and, like The Hobbit, a mere begining.  In my opinion, as the second chapter to the Inheritance saga, Eldest far surpasses Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring.  I say this because it's a wholesome story and easily understood by readers, or audiences, of all ages.  But more importantly the ending leaves you wanting more, you want to know what will become of Eragon and his shimmering dragon... <br />If you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings, or most any fantasy book filled with magic and wonder, it is my opinion the you will love the Inheritance series. <br />Thank you for your time, I hope you found my review helpful... <br />\\"May good fortune rule over you/Peace live in your heart/And the stars watch over you.\\"	2005-10-13

One can realistically work through, and master, this book in three-four weeks.   <br /> <br />Each chapter in the book is short and succinct.  General topics are explained first, and the chapters are rounded out with a practice set to reinforce the principles presented.  Each chapter, including its practice set, can be worked through in an hour. <br /> <br />I recommend that those who purchase this book also purchase a Problem Solvers workbook with solutions.  While the practice sets in Kelly's book are helpful, too few examples are given to truly solidify the principles.   <br /> <br />Thus, if you spend, say, three-and-a-half weeks with Kelly's book, and another five days to a week on the Problem Solvers Guide, you can realistically knock out the basics of Algebra in one month.  After one month, I'm now moving on to Kelly's Complete Idiot's Guide to Pre-Calculus in hopes of eventually tackling Calculus by the end of the year.  <br /> <br />Happy reading.	2005-10-13

I read it to my granddaughter's kindergarten class when we celebrated her 5th birthday...and gave a copy to the class library...and the kids still come up to me when I go to pick her up after school, talking about the book or pretending to be the pigeon!  One of the mothers told me that her daughter made them buy her her own copy, she loved it so much!  Absolutely recommend this book for any 4-to-6 year old; and even the younger ones (age 2-to-3) love the book, too.	2005-10-13

I read this book for the first time in my 4th grade Tier 4 class and still remember how I felt when I read the last lines.  Chills went out all over my body and I was so upset that there wasn't more to the book!  Now, 13 years later, I still get chills at the end.  The whole book is suspenseful and myseterious... it's just wonderful.  The sad thing is that it seems so few people have read it.  I recommend EVERYONE reading it.  It's a light read, but its incredibly engaging.  Frank Bonham has such a wonderfully creative mind! <br /> <br />It's funny and brushes on some very serious subjects, this book is the whole package!

Sometimes it is just annoying, such as when the heading reads \\"Kaplan's basic principles for success on Antonyms are:\\" in a section about Analogies. Other times, it's downright dangerous, such as when it tells you that the correct answer is, say, \\"D\\" and then on the next page they mention that \\"D\\" is obviously wrong because it illustrates a classic trap. What was the correct answer then? They never tell you. Whoops. <br /> <br />I suppose the strategies are worthwhile (so long as you like \\"Here are some traps to avoid,\\" but no help on what to do when you see that particular trap), but the practice tests are, as far as I'm concerned, absolutely unreliable, and thus worthless. <br /> <br />And what's up with the \\"Higher Score Guaranteed?\\" If you spend the many hours it would take to go through this book, spend the hundred + bucks on the test and get a lower score, they'll refund you the fifteen you spent on the book?

The solution to the mystery plot, which centers around Spenser's client's involvement or non-involvement in the shooting, has another \\"ripped from the headlines\\" true-life inspiration, though I won't say which one because I don't want to give away the eventual plot and character revelations.<br /><br />I'll just report, then, that this was a better-than-average installment among recent Spenser novels and it was refreshing that it was JUST a Spenser novel:  It wasn't about Hawk or Susan or Vinnie or anybody else.  Don't get me wrong, the supporting cast in this series is great. But maybe every five books or so we should get a story just like this one, with Spenser trudging through the woods in the rain looking for clues and alone with his thoughts.	2005-10-13

I was eager to read The Secret Life of Bees, but it was hard to come by at the library, so I finally broke down and bought the book.  (I'm quite frugal, so that should give you some context for my review title.)<br /><br />It was rather disappointing, for all the reasons a 2003 one-star review cited: lack of realism in the treatment of Lily's travels and public appearances with Rosaleen and Zack (hard to believe such bi-racial outings didn't elicit more violent and verbal reactions from townfolks and other blacks.); confusing time spans where lots of action takes place that seem to span weeks, but turns out to be much shorter; and Lily's idiocy in not telling the truth upfront to the three sisters.  Also, because I recognized many similar themes and character treatments from Mermaid Chair, I almost felt like I was reading the same book.  I'm sure if Kidd writes another work of fiction, it'll have the same elements of female power-worshiping and ritualistic dances in natural settings. Gag, just a bit too voo dooish and repetitive for me.  I'll save my money for library fines instead.	2005-10-13

Her new novel titled 13 STEPS DOWN is a chilling story of obsession, superstition, hatred, guilt, fantasy lives and murder. Mix Cellini is a disenfranchised young man who makes his living repairing and maintaining exercise equipment. He is superstitious and shudders when he is forced to confront the number 13, which happens to be the number of steps that lead to his flat in a neglected and crumbling old Victorian house. His fears and his belief in ghosts and the occult haunt him. He is single and rents the attic space from Gwendolen Chawcer, an elderly spinster who has lived alone for many years amid the dust, dirt, mess, her cat Otto, and the fabulous collections of books that sustain her life. Mix hates her. And the feeling is mutual. <br /> <br />As the story unfolds we learn that Gwendolen was one of those females whose life was determined and controlled by her overbearing father. After her mother died, she was expected to take care of Mr. Chawcer and never to strike out on her own. Unfortunately, he lived to the ripe-old age of 94, thus never giving his daughter a chance to meet people, especially men. He had made up his mind that she was not \\"marriage material\\" and would be better off reading and learning how to take care of him. Despite her isolation and naivet she fell in love with the young doctor who cared for her father. But once the old man died, she never heard from him again. Nevertheless, she carried a torch for him for 50 years and over time it became a heavy burden for her. <br /> <br />And since her father died, she has lived alone in a few of the many rooms in the house she had grown up in. For her, the structure is familiar and she really doesn't see the crumbling wallpaper, peeling paint, or very out-of-date appliances (which she never uses anyway), nor does she feel the cold. Mix is her first border and he is not happy with his situation. He thinks he can hear \\"drippings and droppings, moths chewing, flakes falling, splinters, rust mildew turning to dust.\\" He bemoans his fate at ever having stepped over the threshold of this place. But once he allows his fantasies to purge any hold on reality he ever had, he has only one purpose and that becomes his whole focus. <br />   <br />Mix, who takes his women where and when he can get them, meets a gorgeous model, Nerissa Nash. As soon as he sets eyes on her, he knows that she must be his and he begins to stalk her. Nerissa is clueless for a good portion of the story, though readers can guess what is going to happen and it is not good. Mix is also obsessed with a notorious doctor who not only performed abortions 50 years ago, but also killed the women he butchered and indulged in the act of necrophilia before he buried them. He is Mix's idol, and Mix takes strength and inspiration from the collection of books he owns that are all about the infamous doctor. <br /> <br />Readers get to meet a number of supporting players, including Madame Shoshanna, the phony and sadistic \\"psychic\\" who meddles with an eye toward trouble; Danila, the young woman Mix meets at a spa and begins to date; and the customers Mix calls on to fix their exercise equipment --- mostly women --- and with whom he indulges in a little extracurricular recreation. But none of this is really important to him. He is fixated on Nerissa to the point where his obsession pushes him over the line from a very neurotic young man to a dangerous psychopath. <br /> <br />Ruth Rendell is a master craftsperson at creating the creepy atmosphere required to write a riveting and compelling psychological thriller. She doesn't need to use an extra word or gesture, or any gratuitous baggage, to draw her readers in and keep them turning pages and biting their nails. Her plots are complex and have enough gravitas to keep the most ardent reader entertained. Because her characters are fully fleshed out and believable, they are also recognizable as people, andthat can be very scary. <br /> <br />In an essay for Kings and Queens of Crime, Val McDermid highlights Rendell's art: \\"Perhaps one of the key reasons for the sustained quality of [her] novels is Ruth Rendell's habit of variety. From the very beginning of her career, she made it plain that she would not be pigeonholed into writing one kind of novel only ... Patricia Highsmith is often cited as the mother of the psychological suspense novel. But for my money, Rendell's influence has been far greater. Highsmith's novels are quintessentially European, whereas Ruth Rendell has created a sub-genre that speaks more resonantly to Brits and Americans.\\" <br /> <br />The tone of Rendell's books is always highly suspenseful and tightly constructed. Her greatest talent is her ability to create characters and plots that are multilayered, interesting and a challenge to readers. She is one of the small coterie of novelists who can manage to produce work that is always new and no two books are the same Her body of work is legion and readers can always count on getting a fresh, well-crafted book. In an interview for Financial Literary Newsletter she says, \\"There's a lot of satisfaction also, in knowing that people feel that once they've got hold of a book of yours, they can't put it down. It distracts them from everything else, it takes them from all their duties, and they just have to finish the book. And that's a very satisfying thing.\\" <br /> <br />13 STEPS DOWN is more confirmation of how much Rendell deserves the fine reputation she has earned among readers and other writers. Those new to Rendell's more than 70 books will find her latest novel unique, meeting the high standards that Rendell has always imposed upon herself and that has become expected from her by an adoring public. This book is a keeper, definitely to be read more than once. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum	2005-10-13

(Boston Globe-Horn Book Awards (Awards))	Books	5	28	29	N	N	The attraction to Traction Man, man	It's funny, but I think we can say that the picture-book-superhero-genre is still in its infancy.  There's, \\"Kapow\\", of course and \\"The Adventures of Sparrowboy\\", but these are stories of ordinary kids being super.  Far more difficult, in a way, is a story about an action figure.  Now there is no lack of stories where toys take on a life of their own when their owners aren't around.  With, \\"Traction Man Is Here\\", however, author Mini Grey turns this conceit on its head.  The hero of this book may be an action figure like Buzz Lightyear (though he's an entirely different type of toy) but any adventures you read about in this book are from the head of the boy moving Traction Man about.  You may not see the kids' hands and Traction Man may appear to move on his own accord, but there is little doubt who the real brains behind the operation is.  It makes, oddly enough, for thrilling reading.<br /><br />A boy writes a note to Santa requesting another Traction Man since his old one was involved in what is simply referred to as, \\"the Terrible Parachute Accident\\".  Santa may not be aware of the boy's request, but his parents are certainly on the ball because Christmas Day brings a brand new bright and shiny Traction Man (complete with Dazzle-Painted Battler Pants).  Thus begin our hero's adventures. Each time he appears, his new outfit is lovingly described (as in the sentence, \\"Traction Man is crawling through the overgrown shrubbery near the Pond, wearing Jungle Pants, Camouflage Vest and Sweaty Bandanna\\").  This is all well and good up until the moment the family goes to knit-crazy Granny's.  Traction Man receives an all-in-one knitted green romper suit and matches bonnet.  It's adorable and completely inappropriate for his line of work.  Fortunately, Traction Man's quick thinking sidekick Scrubbing Brush finds a way to solve the romper problem and save some spoons in need.<br /><br />Right from the start I recognized that Grey was doing something that few authors remember from their childhood.  When I was a kid, any and every inanimate object was fair game for my imaginings.  Likewise in this book, Traction Man battles pillows and sponges and befriends a friendly brush as well.  As an author, Grey has a real feel for what it's like to be a kid playing with a favorite toy.  The book looks like a comic book at all the right points and really does become quite exciting, almost in spite of its low-rent sets.<br /><br />Grey's attention to detail is also stunning.  The night the boy gets the present containing Traction Man on his bed you can see an exciting adult foot who's sock has (oh joy) unraveled at the heel.  I OWN socks just like that!  This probably explains why Granny's so gung ho about knitting more for the family.  Toys that do battle or are saved by Traction Man in the course of the tale are visible on the boy's floor right at the book's start.  I also loved that his older sister is continually carrying around her own Christmas present: a copy of Practical Woodworking.  You hardly ever see her when her nose isn't pressed to the pages.  I like to think that some of the boy's wooden toys came from her hands.  Words spoken by real people always appear as italicized printed texts.  Plus, the interiors and exteriors of homes aren't only authentic but detailed intricately.  It doesn't hurt either that Traction Man's a bit of a hunk.  I don't usually go for those muscly guys, but there's something appealing in this fella's face.  Just a thought.<br /><br />And though this comment is a bit out of place, I'd just like to point out that when Cupcake is being held prisoner by the evil Dr. Sock (yes, it pretty much consists of an actual sock wrapped around a cupcake) he whispers what I consider to be the funniest line in the book: \\"You will be my wife\\".<br /><br />\\"Traction Man Is Here\\" has already won (as of the writing of this review) the 2005 Boston Globe Book Award and it promises to win many more as the months and years go by.  This is apparently Ms. Grey's second picture book so far.  The world would be a poorer place if it were to be the last.  Appropriate for guys and gals alike.years go by.

Most of us manage heterogeneous networks and need good references  when swithcing between Windows and Unix platforms. This book not only provides an excellent compilation of scripts, but also points out many useful tools found in resource kits and support tool packages. The introduction to each chapter outlining the GUI tools, command-line tools, and scripting specifics that are covered in the chapter make the book easy to follow. You might have written or gathered some of these scripts throughout the years, but it is nice to see a good compilation gathered in one place. Very helpful!	2005-10-13

I've been a big Red Sox and Johnny Damon fan for a long time. Now, I don't think so much of Johnny. I figured, with the book being billed as a narrative on his baseball life, that it would be very biographical--what happened to him throughout his life. As others have said, he certainly did not fail to highlight the amazing ballplayer he saw in himself. He genuinely thinks very highly of himself. It was quite shocking. The one part that really brought me over the edge of not liking the book so much was when he talked about how he should have made the All-Star team, but Joe Torre never picked him. At one point, he also says that he had a chance to be named the 30th man to the All-Star roster, but Ichiro's fans in Japan got on the internet and voted. I can certainly understand those feelings if they were coming from a fan. Like I said, I really loved the image of Johnny Damon I knew before. I am sorry to say that he really did come off as a bit of a jerk in the book.	2005-10-13

Faith McNulty and Steven Kellogg have done a great job of showing and telling children what a trip to the moon would really be like. <br /> <br />One thing that is great about this book is the way experiences and things that are familiar to children are used to describe extraordinarily UN-familiar experiences and ideas. The book is written in the second person point of view -- directly addressing the reader. I thought it was brilliant the way McNulty captures what a child's (or anyone's) feelings might be as they hurtle through the dark expanse of space, far away from the comfort of Earth and home. (\\"Up here in space you may feel very alone. Don't look back at the Earth. It would make you even lonelier.\\")  <br /> <br />Kellogg illustrates a variety of moods, experiences and concepts from eye-catching perspectives. There is whimsy: an astronaut floats weightlessly around inside the capsule amidst a swarm of playing cards, and, later in the book an unexpected herd of hypothetical moon cows makes an appearance! There is quite a lot of loneliness in Kellogg's space: A lone astronaut hops around and explores the strange, barren, black and grey moonscape for several pages. In a compelling two-page spread, Kellogg depicts a lone astronaut, standing on the Moon under a lonely black sky -- the scene is printed with the darkest jet black ink I have EVER seen printed in any picture book. At the end of the journey, the astronaut returns to an exuberant fold out frieze of Earth's magnificently varied biodiversity, under a shining sun and clear sky with children swimming in fresh, clear water -- the essential element that makes our planet habitable. I was especially pleased to see this book, since another excellent children's book about the Moon, E.C. and Robin Krupp's book, The Moon and You, is not readily available anymore. I highly recommend this book for any elementary school library, or for the book collections of Kindergarteners to second graders. I also would not be surprised if it wins some children's book awards in the months to come.	2005-10-13

As usual with Orson, this is a very thoughtful and complex book. I think this is probably my favorite of the Shadow sub-series but definitely not my favorite Orson Scott Card book.<br /><br />I find his exploration of the political future of Earth to be quite fascinating; everything from an isolated and therefore almost powerless United States to an uneasy alliance of the Muslim Nations. Very interesting an well thought out. His development of the erstwhile villain Peter Wiggin into a man of peace is also fascinating; I always like it when characters become multi-dimensional in a book.<br /><br />Overall, another gem in Card's crown.

I think they are poorly written and predictable.  I have not enjoyed one thus far.  CSI has a good show and a GREAT computer game series, but not a good set of novels in any way.  Parts of it sound like a kid wrote it.

Isabel Hull exposes the flaw of this approach in her book. Accroding to Hull, German soldiers committed numoerous atrocities from the Herro uprising to the First World War due to belief in absolute victory and the absence of civilian supervision. This was seen in the destruction of the Herro tribe in which the Germans delibrately starved the tribe to death, and the complaints by the civilian governors were ignored by the German government. The German government imposed no controls on the military because the conservative political parties supported the army and the SPD did not want to appear as though they were not supporting the troops. The German army continued these same practices during the First World War through the massacre of Belgian civilians, and the expulsion of French civilians. Also the German army encouraged the Turks in their genocide against the Armenians. These measures only tarnished Germany's reputation and were militarily counterproductive. I would strongly reccomend this book to people like Robert Kaplan, who wants the military to run wild in foreign adventures.	2005-10-13

Even that redoutable master of brilliant and modern-reading prose, Wilkie Collins, cannot keep up with Verne at his best. How so much seemingly tedious description is lifted to this level of fluidity - flat out amazing.<br />Verne's genius for what we today call Science Fiction sometimes obscures his even greater gift, for pure narrative. And with the  Mysterious Island in this new translation his talent is on full display. Verne creates with this island an entire new world, a sort of Eden, and within this landscape plays out an entirely breathtaking story. Lingering in the backdrop, Verne's embittered alter ego Nemo balances the one-sided idealism of the castaways.  On a scale with the Count of Monte Cristo, and the literary culmination of the enlightenment/scientific shipwrecked theme,(versus the 'humans are animals Lord of the Flies alternative), the Mysterious Island builds steadily to a tremendous finish.<br />  When we read 19th century fiction much of the time phrases and scenes are flat, stale; even the best writers, Dickens, or Trollope, Balzac or Hawthorne, have streches of writing that just doesn't read as anything but dated. But Verne's best books, and this certainly is one of them, are as remarkable for their uncluttered fine prose writing as they are for their famous plots and explorations.<br />If Verne was no great creator of character, he makes up for it by some of the most eminently readable works ever penned.<br />A wonderful book for reading during a cold long winter weekend.	2005-10-13

Why do I then only give it three stars? The author explains everything very well. HOWEVER, for someone that's never used the router before, words often leave you fumbling. A picture is worth 1000 words and it couldn't be more true in this case. There are pictures. Just no enough of them and they're in a weird black and white and funny kind of red deal. Not very clear at all. So you often have two pages of words where one clear picture would have replaced all of it and done a better job. <br /> <br />The second problem I had was the fact that this book essentially ignores the plunge router. This is fine. He pretty much shows how you can do everything with the vertical and horizontal router table and the many, many jigs, fences and accessories. However, I bought a mid power (2 1/4 HP) porter cable plunge router and almost feel that I should return it for the 3 HP one which would have cost me the same amount of money because his bias seems to indicate the plunge router is not necessary. <br /> <br />Finally, the part where he mentions how to add a switch to your router table is confusing. Thank goodness I know how electrical work, so I could figure things out. However, SJT appliance cable is not something you can pick up at your local home depot. A source list on this would have been extremely helpful. <br /> <br />All in all, however, it is still a great book.	2005-10-13

I used the 3 glowing reviews on this product to make my decision in purchasing it. Before I gripe, I'll try to find some nice things to say. I was very impressed with the production quality of the book and the detailed information in the biography section. The transcriptions were note-for-note pretty good. The tab's a little off from video recordings of Django playing these same tunes, but the notes are right.<br /><br />That's about where it ends, though. The recording, while technically a decent recording, offers no insight to Django's phrasing or timing of the notes. There are entire passages where it felt like Rod was just playing the notes and nothing more. Other times, notes were missed, played sloppily or not picked up by the mic, leading to a sloppy, unrehearsed sound. There's an entire passage in the Minor Swing recording where Rod plays the most boring note-for-note reiteration of his transcription despite Django's clear swing rhythm and sliding techniques on the same passage in the recording it was transcribed from.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book to get as a bio, and a pretty good one for the transcriptions. However, don't try to learn from the CD, because Django would probably be rolling over in his grave. Learn from the master himself, and those that came after him (Fapy Lafertin, The Rosenberg Trio, etc.). They are the real deal, and they will play it right. Copy them, not Rod.	2005-10-13

Now he was back, happily reformed, bursting with yuletide cheer--and armed with a very tempting proposition... <br /> <br />And now for my review (drum roll please!) <br />Each story comes with a recipe at the beginning. <br /> <br />The first story was BORING. I couldn't even finish it. There was more emphasis on the fact that Monroe liked Olivia's biscuits than on the romance. I am not kidding. She makes biscuits like a dozen times in twenty pages. Yeah, yeah, I know, the way to a man's heart it through his stomach, but I need a bit more motivation for romance than that. If all he likes about her are her stupid biscuits, he might be tempted to cheat if a pastry chef came along who can make him croisants! (ha ha!) I got so bored by the lack of real character development that I skipped to the next story. Amazingly, the recipe is for Baker's Clay Christmas Ornaments, and not biscuits! Two stars. <br /> <br />The second story was better, but not a keeper. It was an amusing one-time read. I liked the mystery even though I did figure it out before it was revealed. Still, it had its funny moments, but I wouldn't bother reading it again. The recipe is for sugar pie. Three stars. <br /> <br />The last story was very good. I am currently re-reading it. If youlike stories about reunited love, then you will like this one. It was sweet and clean, and very nearly made me cry at the \\"black moment\\". The recipe is for Triple Chocolate Pate. (I haven't made it, but it sounds yummy!) Four stars. <br /> <br />The last story made this book worth the $$$ I paid for it. I would recommend trying to find this in a thrift or used book store, or maybe at the library, as it's not worth spending a lot of money, but it is an enjoyable read (at least the last two thirds of it is!)	2005-10-13
US	53083398	R1G9ZXKEUYJZMW	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A fantasy adventure novel with depth	The Curse of Chalion is one of the best fantasy novels of the latest years. It belongs to that rare category, which also contains Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, C.S.Lewis' Perelandra, Miller's Canticle for Leibowitz, or Anderson's Orbit unlimited, which combine an interesting adventure plot with important ethical dilemmas and deep questions about the nature of man and God. <br />In this novel, as deftly crafted as her Vorkosigan saga, Lois McMaster Bujold has pushed further the bounds of subcreation (as defined by Tolkien in his paper On fairie stories). She presents us, not just a coherent imaginary universe, but even a strange God, which rather than three persons displays five. However, under the superficial differences, this God is not unrecognizably different from the one we have heard about (I don't dare say that we know). <br />Cazaril, the hero, is clearly a figure of Christ: his death becomes the rent between the worlds, through which one of the divine persons enters the world of matter to lift the curse of Chalion, a kind of original sin. He is even, in some sense, resurrected. This parallel, however, does not push the story out of its logical lines, but is smoothly embedded in it. In fact, one could say, it is the other way around: the story pushes the message and makes it take the appropriate form for the world being described, in a show of the literary masterly of the author. <br />The book is interspersed with pearls worthy of being remembered. The following are a few of them: <br />To a man of certain age... all young ladies start to look delightful. It's the first symptom of senility. <br />[God] does not grant miracles for our purposes, but for [His purposes]. <br />Prayer, he suspected... was putting one foot in front of the other. Moving all the same. <br />Men have always a choice - if not whether, then how, they may endure. <br />[God is] on our side... can we fail?... Yes... and when we fail, [God does] too.	2005-10-13

Let me just say it straight:  The Yankees is a cult for social club zombies.  There is no such thing as the Yankees.  There is only such thing as other teams' MVPs.  (Kinda like that song OPP.)    Living in NY and hearing people idolize the Yankees really grosses you out if you are on the outside looking in.  Watch the YES network and watch Yankees highlights from 300 years ago, reminding you of the history of your cult.  I'm glad the Yankees do horribly.  Yes.  Glad.  And you know why.  Writing about is is redudant, for now I will only poke fun at the modern Yankees.    I was raised in Houston, so painfully I was an Astros fan for a couple decades now.  I laughed hysterically when the Stros NO-HIT the Yankees with like 6 pitchers I believe.  I even kept the Newsday paper it was printed on the back cover of.  Priceless.  Then the Fish beat them in the WS.  Classic.  Then, lo and behold, the Red Sox resurrect themselves against the Yankees and reverse-sweep and reverse their curse on to them.  I don't care if humanity gets wiped out by aliens or nukes or whatever - we MUST preserve what happened in 2004 between the Yankees/Red Sox.  Hey, why don't we start by replaying it over the YES airwaves for the next 60 decades.    There is this guy that I lived with who was a hysterical Yankees cult zombie.  He claimed that \\"nobody can beat the Yankees, the Yankees beat the Yankees, they beat themselves only.\\"  Now it is true that the Yankees beat themsleves (if by \\"Yankees\\" you mean Steinbrenner) but oh my do other teams whoop them silly.  The Angels, Fish, Red Sox... Devil Rays.  Do I care that other teams own the Yankees?  Nope.  I care that people are so brainwashed by Yankee propaganda that they actually do, and not only do, but can't accept reality about such things.  If you are a Yankees fan: Sit down. Take a deep breath.  Now let it out.  Relax.  The Yankees are a bad team and they are owned.  There.  That wasn't so hard now was it?    Here is why people hate the Yankees.  If you have a team with a low or medium pay roll, and you have a player who is special and pretty much carried your team for a season, kiss him goodbye, he's a Yankee next season.  How fun is it to have that on your conscience every time somebody is a great player?  I'll tell ya this, and I'm sure you will agree - it ruins the sport.  I am not a football fan, but I do love the playoffs in football.  Why?  Because of the variety of the champs.  They win with what they have.  Sure they trade, but they don't buy everyone's MVPs the next season.  They have their team captains that sail the ship and a solid coach.  Every sport is going to have its Clippers, Browns, and Devil Rays.  That is not the issue.  The issue is that if the Rays had a shining star, there is only a dust cloud where his body once played the season before.  Other sports will surround their special talents with other players who share the same determination to win.  The salaray cap helps this happen.      Here, let me break it down for you yet again.  After the Yankees \\"beat themselves\\" to the Angels (for the second time within 5 years), there was an article in the newspaper with a \\"sports writer\\" discussing his \\"plan\\" for 2006.  It involved attaining Torii Hunter, Barry Zito, Rafael Furcal, Manny Ramirez, and John Olerud.  He even talked about getting Johnny Damon and some other guys.  Case in point?  Another Frankenstein team featuring stars from other teams as the solution to the problem.  Yes, bring in more people who don't know each other to magically fix the problem that has started before they came into the picture.  No. This is not a sound solution to anything.  How does this happen?  No salary cap, greedy players, and a sport with no soul.  May I suggest, mr. sports writer that you make better with what you HAVE and building a team rather than next year's side show you only love to hate?    Consider the fact that they get bought from other teams as heros and leave as zeros.  Why do they go from moutains on other teams to valleys in pinstripes?  Because the Yankees headquarters looks desperate and pathetic begging for others to come in and save them.  I mean it really is sad.  But if you can't try to learn from your mistakes and keep repeating them, you don't get my sympathy.  Only a couple laughs.    It isn't homeruns the Yankees need, its a personality, a heart, a team.  They don't need guys who think homeruns and strikeouts are owed to them, but guys who will break and bleed for them.  Its not even HOW you spend the money but WHY.  If you're spending alot on a big name just to fill seats, you have received your reward.  If you spend big just because you don't want your rivals to have a player, you roll the dice on the field and in the clubhouse.  You see the Yankees is a Rubick's cube of a team.  A Frankenstein.  An arm from Seattle, a leg from Pittsburgh, a toe from St. Louis, an ear from San Diego, and half a cheek from Cleveland.  They went looking for pieces but have no heart.   Aside from Tino and Jeter, there is no such thing as a Yankee anymore.    The only time I cared about the Yankees was when they had O'Neil, Brosius (sp), Sojo and all those guys.  They were fun to watch because they weren't all superstars, and you wanted to see the skills of guys who wanted to fight for their championship.

And, man, am I glad I did. This book was fresh and hot. I'm not going to give anything away, but the suspense of the story actually had me guessing what was going to happen next. I literally couldn't put it down because I got so into it. It's cool to see teenage heros (if you want to call them that) acting like teenagers. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in a refreshing graphic novel experience. Enjoy!	2005-10-13

US	52117048	RRI42TFFIWTFT	1400032717	459979615	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A Parent's Review	As an adult reader of this book I admired the author's skill in crafting and revealing a protagonist with such a unique outlook (and one that evidently rings true for many people). The plot is artfully devised to convey some very interesting character studies of the autistic \\"author\\" of the story and his parents. In reading this book I found much to consider about the nature of what it means to be human, humane, \\"normal,\\" functional, and brave, among other things, and I concur with the many other reviewers here who found this book to be ironic, poignant, resonant, and of true literary worth.    But as a parent confronted with this book being assigned to my child in school, I feel that the following facts about the book should be made known in advance to parents in considering whether this material is appropriate for their own children:    The novel is filled throughout (from page 4 through page 214) with extreme profanity including the nastiest four-letter words which cannot be reproduced here without getting my review deleted. The rationale for this is that the protagonist has a photographic memory and no ability to censor incoming sensory stimulation, so the inclusion of this language simulates a replication of his surroundings as he moves through his lower-class neighborhood and around the transportation system from his home and into London. Also included are Christopher's uncensored musings about toileting situations and \\"doing sex.\\" Christopher is a physically chaste \\"emotional innocent,\\" but this book deals with adult subjects viewed through his eyes, including infidelity, a marital breakup, arguments among foul-mouthed adults, and Christopher finding pornography in his father's bedroom. Violent scenes include Christopher discovering a neighborhood dog murdered with a pitchfork, Christopher and his father physically fighting, and Christopher hitting a policeman and being arrested.    I found it telling that in his interview with [...] (\\"The Curiously Irresistible Literary Debut of Mark Haddon\\" by Dave Weich), the author, Mark Haddon, admitted that he had definitely written this book as his first novel intended for adults (he was before this solely an author of children's books). He was surprised, he said, when he gave the manuscript to his agent and she said, \\"Let's try it with both adult and children's publishers and see what happens.\\"     What happened is ringing cash registers in suburban America as teachers assign this novel to our children. Next time, Mr. Haddon, please stand firm with your better instincts. Your adult writing can stand successfully on its own with adults where it belongs.	2005-10-13

I never quite believed Lord Scarecrow and Jack could be real (whereas I'm still convinced Lyra and her Daemon are out there somewhere from \\"His Dark Materials\\").  It's always a bit of a disappointment to not become so engrossed in a book, the characters become real.  However, that's about the only disappointment.<br /><br />Lord Scarecrow and his turnip head (though I kept picturing him as the scarecrow from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\") is anxious to seek his fortune and rescue his birthplace from being polluted.  On their tail is a lawyer working for the Buffalonis, the polluting family, who reminds me of Count Olaf.  Poor Jack just wants to stay alive and not be hungry.  In between are many adventures including a desert island, joining the military, which all leads to a climactic courtroom scene.<br /><br />A great fairy tale for the preteen set (and us older preteens as well).	2005-10-13

If you haven't been upset at our current tax system before you read this book you definitely will be after.  Considering how long this plan has been in front of the Congress and how great an alternative it is to our current system it really makes one wonder how anything progresses in this country. <br /> <br />This is a must read for everyone regardless of political affiliation and political interest.	2005-10-13

As a retired physician (Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine), I have always delighted in books that speak to children of all ages and to the child within each of us. Such a book is Barbara Meislin's colorful, thougtful and poignant \\"No One Can Ever Steal Your Rainbow.\\" Exquisitely illustrated, it is accompanied by a CD of the title song, written and performed by the author!  The appearance of rainbows (including this book) at times of personal indecision have always helped to lead me further along my life journey. I have delighted in sharing this beautifully conceived work with a wide spectrum of friends and family since meeting the suthor from whom I obtained by personal copy.  It reminds me that what I hold dearest are not the external things, but the treasures that dwell within my heart...none of which can be stolen.	2005-10-13
